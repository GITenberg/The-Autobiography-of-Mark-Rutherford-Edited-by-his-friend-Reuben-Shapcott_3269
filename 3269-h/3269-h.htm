3</span>PREFACE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THE SECOND EDITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present edition is a reprint of
the first, with corrections of several mistakes which had been
overlooked.</p>
<p>There is one observation which I may perhaps be permitted to
make on re-reading after some years this autobiography.&nbsp;
Rutherford, at any rate in his earlier life, was an example of
the danger and the folly of cultivating thoughts and reading
books to which he was not equal, and which tend to make a man
lonely.</p>
<p>It is all very well that remarkable persons should occupy
themselves with exalted subjects, which are out of the ordinary
road which ordinary humanity treads; but we who are not
remarkable make a very great mistake if <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>we have anything to do with
them.&nbsp; If we wish to be happy, and have to live with average
men and women, as most of us have to live, we must learn to take
an interest in the topics which concern average men and
women.&nbsp; We think too much of ourselves.&nbsp; We ought not
to sacrifice a single moment&rsquo;s pleasure in our attempt to
do something which is too big for us, and as a rule, men and
women are always attempting what is too big for them.&nbsp; To
ninety-nine young men out of a hundred, or perhaps ninety-nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a hundred thousand,
the wholesome healthy doctrine is, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother
yourselves with what is beyond you; try to lead a sweet, clean,
wholesome life, keep yourselves in health above everything, stick
to your work, and when your day is done amuse and refresh
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not only a duty to ourselves, but it is a duty to others
to take this course.&nbsp; Great men do the world much good, but
not without <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>some harm, and we have no business to be troubling
ourselves with their dreams if we have duties which lie nearer
home amongst persons to whom these dreams are
incomprehensible.&nbsp; Many a man goes into his study, shuts
himself up with his poetry or his psychology, comes out, half
understanding what he has read, is miserable because he cannot
find anybody with whom he can talk about it, and misses
altogether the far more genuine joy which he could have obtained
from a game with his children or listening to what his wife had
to tell him about her neighbours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, miss, you haven&rsquo;t looked at your new bonnet
to-day,&rdquo; said a servant girl to her young mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, why should I?&nbsp; I did not want to go
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can you? why, I get mine out and look at it
every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was happy for a whole fortnight with a happiness cheap at
a very high price.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>That same
young mistress was very caustic upon the women who block the
pavement outside drapers&rsquo; shops, but surely she was
unjust.&nbsp; They always seem unconscious, to be enjoying
themselves intensely and most innocently, more so probably than
an audience at a Wagner concert.&nbsp; Many persons with refined
minds are apt to depreciate happiness, especially if it is of
&ldquo;a low type.&rdquo;&nbsp; Broadly speaking, it is the one
thing worth having, and low or high, if it does no mischief, is
better than the most spiritual misery.</p>
<p>Metaphysics and theology, including all speculations on the
why and the wherefore, optimism, pessimism, freedom, necessity,
causality, and so forth, are not only for the most part loss of
time, but frequently ruinous.&nbsp; It is no answer to say that
these things force themselves upon us, and that to every question
we are bound to give or try to give an answer.&nbsp; It is true,
although strange, that there are multitudes of burning questions
which we must <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>do our best to ignore, to forget their existence; and it
is not more strange, after all, than many other facts in this
wonderfully mysterious and defective existence of ours.&nbsp; One
fourth of life is intelligible, the other three-fourths is
unintelligible darkness; and our earliest duty is to cultivate
the habit of not looking round the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine
with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy
works.&nbsp; Let thy garments be always white, and let not thy
head lack ointment.&nbsp; Live joyfully with the wife whom thou
lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which He hath
given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is
thy portion in life.&rdquo;</p>

13</span>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHILDHOOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that I have completed my
autobiography up to the present year, I sometimes doubt whether
it is right to publish it.&nbsp; Of what use is it, many persons
will say, to present to the world what is mainly a record of
weaknesses and failures?&nbsp; If I had any triumphs to tell; if
I could show how I had risen superior to poverty and suffering;
if, in short, I were a hero of any kind whatever, I might perhaps
be justified in communicating my success to mankind, and
stimulating them to do as I have done.&nbsp; But mine is the tale
of a commonplace life, perplexed by many problems I have never
solved; disturbed by many difficulties I have never surmounted;
and blotted by ignoble concessions which are a constant
regret.</p>
<p>I have decided, however, to let the manuscript remain.&nbsp; I
will not destroy it, although I will not take the responsibility
of printing it.&nbsp; Somebody may think it worth preserving; and
there are two reasons why they may think so, if there are no
others.&nbsp; In the first place it has some little historic
value, for I feel increasingly that the race to which I belonged
is fast passing away, and that the Dissenting minister of the
present day is a different being altogether from the Dissenting
minister of forty years ago.</p>
<p>In the next place, I have observed that the mere knowing that
other people have been tried as we have been tried is a
consolation to us, and that we are relieved by the assurance that
our sufferings are not special and peculiar, but common to us
with many others.&nbsp; Death has always been a terror to me, and
at times, nay generally, religion and philosophy have been
altogether unavailing to mitigate the terror in any way.&nbsp;
But it has been a comfort to me to reflect that whatever death
may be, it is the inheritance of the whole human race; that I am
not singled out, but shall merely have to pass through what the
weakest have had to pass through before me.&nbsp; In the worst of
maladies, worst at least to me, those which are hypochondriacal,
the healing effect which is produced by the visit of a friend who
can simply say, &ldquo;I have endured all that,&rdquo; is most
marked.&nbsp; So it is not impossible that some few whose
experience has been like mine may, by my example, be freed from
that sense of solitude which they find so depressing.</p>
<p>I was born, just before the Liverpool and Manchester Railway
was opened, in a small country town in one of the Midland
shires.&nbsp; It is now semi-manufacturing, at the junction of
three or four lines of railway, with hardly a trace left of what
it was fifty years ago.&nbsp; It then consisted of one long main
street, with a few other streets branching from it at
right-angles.&nbsp; Through this street the mail-coach rattled at
night, and the huge waggon rolled through it, drawn by four
horses, which twice a week travelled to and from London and
brought us what we wanted from the great and unknown city.</p>
<p>My father and mother belonged to the ordinary English middle
class of well-to-do shop-keepers.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s family
came from a little distance, but my father&rsquo;s had lived in
those parts for centuries.&nbsp; I remember perfectly well how
business used to be carried on in those days.&nbsp; There was
absolutely no competition, and although nobody in the town who
was in trade got rich, except the banker and the brewer, nearly
everybody was tolerably well off, and certainly not pressed with
care as their successors are now.&nbsp; The draper, who lived a
little way above us, was a deacon in our chapel, and every
morning, soon after breakfast, he would start off for his walk of
about four miles, stopping by the way to talk to his neighbours
about the events of the day.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock or
thereabouts he would return and would begin work.&nbsp; Everybody
took an hour for dinner&mdash;between one and two&mdash;and at
that time, especially on a hot July afternoon, the High Street
was empty from end to end, and the profoundest peace reigned.</p>
<p>My life as a child falls into two portions, sharply
divided&mdash;week-day and Sunday.&nbsp; During the week-day I
went to the public school, where I learned little or nothing that
did me much good.&nbsp; The discipline of the school was
admirable, and the headmaster was penetrated with a most lofty
sense of duty, but the methods of teaching were very
imperfect.&nbsp; In Latin we had to learn the Eton Latin Grammar
till we knew every word of it by heart, but we did scarcely any
retranslation from English into Latin.&nbsp; Much of our time was
wasted on the merest trifles, such as learning to write, for
example, like copperplate, and, still more extraordinary, in
copying the letters of the alphabet as they are used in
printing.</p>
<p>But we had two half-holidays in the week, which seem to me now
to have been the happiest part of my life.&nbsp; A river ran
through the town, and on summer Wednesdays and Saturdays we
wandered along its banks for miles, alternately fishing and
bathing.&nbsp; I remember whole afternoons in June, July, and
August, passed half-naked or altogether naked in the solitary
meadows and in the water; I remember the tumbling weir with the
deep pool at the bottom in which we dived; I remember, too, the
place where we used to swim across the river with our clothes on
our heads, because there was no bridge near, and the frequent
disaster of a slip of the braces in the middle of the water, so
that shirt, jacket, and trousers were soaked, and we had to lie
on the grass in the broiling sun without a rag on us till
everything was dry again.</p>
<p>In winter our joys were of a different kind but none the less
delightful.&nbsp; If it was a frost, we had skating; not like
skating on a London pond, but over long reaches, and if the locks
had not intervened, we might have gone a day&rsquo;s journey on
the ice without a stoppage.&nbsp; If there was no ice, we had
football, and what was still better, we could get up a
steeplechase&mdash;on foot straight across hedge and ditch.</p>
<p>In after-years, when I lived in London, I came to know
children who went to school in Gower Street, and travelled
backwards and forwards by omnibus&mdash;children who had no other
recreation than an occasional visit to the Zoological Gardens, or
a somewhat sombre walk up to Hampstead to see their aunt; and I
have often regretted that they never had any experience of those
perfect poetic pleasures which the boy enjoys whose childhood is
spent in the country, and whose home is there.&nbsp; A country
boarding-school is something altogether different.</p>
<p>On the Sundays, however, the compensation came.&nbsp; It was a
season of unmixed gloom.&nbsp; My father and mother were rigid
Calvinistic Independents, and on that day no newspaper nor any
book more secular than the Evangelical Magazine was
tolerated.&nbsp; Every preparation for the Sabbath had been made
on the Saturday, to avoid as much as possible any work.&nbsp; The
meat was cooked beforehand, so that we never had a hot dinner
even in the coldest weather; the only thing hot which was
permitted was a boiled suet pudding, which cooked itself while we
were at chapel, and some potatoes which were prepared after we
came home.&nbsp; Not a letter was opened unless it was clearly
evident that it was not on business, and for opening these an
apology was always offered that it was possible they might
contain some announcement of sickness.&nbsp; If on cursory
inspection they appeared to be ordinary letters, although they
might be from relations or friends, they were put away.</p>
<p>After family prayer and breakfast the business of the day
began with the Sunday-school at nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We were
taught our Catechism and Bible there till a quarter past
ten.&nbsp; We were then marched across the road into the chapel,
a large old-fashioned building dating from the time of Charles
II.&nbsp; The floor was covered with high pews.&nbsp; The roof
was supported by three or four tall wooden pillars which ran from
the ground to the ceiling, and the galleries by shorter
pillars.&nbsp; There was a large oak pulpit on one side against
the wall, and down below, immediately under the minister, was the
&ldquo;singing pew,&rdquo; where the singers and musicians sat,
the musicians being performers on the clarionet, flute, violin,
and violoncello.&nbsp; Right in front was a long enclosure,
called the communion pew, which was usually occupied by a number
of the poorer members of the congregation.</p>
<p>There were three services every Sunday, besides intermitting
prayer-meetings, but these I did not as yet attend.&nbsp; Each
service consisted of a hymn, reading the Bible, another hymn, a
prayer, the sermon, a third hymn, and a short final prayer.&nbsp;
The reading of the Bible was unaccompanied with any observations
or explanations, and I do not remember that I ever once heard a
mistranslation corrected.</p>
<p>The first, or long prayer, as it was called, was a horrible
hypocrisy, and it was a sore tax on the preacher to get through
it.&nbsp; Anything more totally unlike the model recommended to
us in the New Testament cannot well be imagined.&nbsp; It
generally began with a confession that we were all sinners, but
no individual sins were ever confessed, and then ensued a kind of
dialogue with God, very much resembling the speeches which in
later years I have heard in the House of Commons from the movers
and seconders of addresses to the Crown at the opening of
Parliament.</p>
<p>In all the religion of that day nothing was falser than the
long prayer.&nbsp; Direct appeal to God can only be justified
when it is passionate.&nbsp; To come maundering into His presence
when we have nothing particular to say is an insult, upon which
we should never presume if we had a petition to offer to any
earthly personage.&nbsp; We should not venture to take up His
time with commonplaces or platitudes; but our minister seemed to
consider that the Almighty, who had the universe to govern, had
more leisure at His command that the idlest lounger at a
club.&nbsp; Nobody ever listened to this performance.&nbsp; I was
a good child on the whole, but I am sure I did not; and if the
chapel were now in existence, there might be traced on the flap
of the pew in which we sat many curious designs due to these
dreary performances.</p>
<p>The sermon was not much better.&nbsp; It generally consisted
of a text, which was a mere peg for a discourse, that was pretty
much the same from January to December.&nbsp; The minister
invariably began with the fall of man; propounded the scheme of
redemption, and ended by depicting in the morning the blessedness
of the saints, and in the evening the doom of the lost.&nbsp;
There was a tradition that in the morning there should be
&ldquo;experience&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, comfort for the
elect, and that the evening should be appropriated to their less
fortunate brethren.</p>
<p>The evening service was the most trying to me of all
these.&nbsp; I never could keep awake, and knew that to sleep
under the Gospel was a sin.&nbsp; The chapel was lighted in
winter by immense chandeliers with tiers of candles all
round.&nbsp; These required perpetual snuffing, and I can see the
old man going round the chandeliers in the middle of the service
with a mighty pair of snuffers which opened and shut with a loud
click.&nbsp; How I envied him because he had semi-secular
occupation which prevented that terrible drowsiness!&nbsp; How I
envied the pew-opener, who was allowed to stand at the vestry
door, and could slip into the vestry every now and then, or even
into the burial-ground if he heard irreverent boys playing
there!&nbsp; The atmosphere of the chapel on hot nights was most
foul, and this added to my discomfort.&nbsp; Oftentimes in
winter, when no doors or windows were open, I have seen the glass
panes streaming with wet inside, and women carried out
fainting.</p>
<p>On rare occasions I was allowed to go with my father when he
went into the villages to preach.&nbsp; As a deacon he was also a
lay-preacher, and I had the ride in the gig out and home, and tea
at a farm-house.</p>
<p>Perhaps I shall not have a better opportunity to say that,
with all these drawbacks, my religious education did confer upon
me some positive advantages.&nbsp; The first was a rigid regard
for truthfulness.&nbsp; My parents never would endure a lie or
the least equivocation.&nbsp; The second was purity of life, and
I look upon this as a simply incalculable gain.&nbsp; Impurity
was not an excusable weakness in the society in which I lived; it
was a sin for which dreadful punishment was reserved.&nbsp; The
reason for my virtue may have been a wrong reason, but, anyhow, I
was saved, and being saved, much more was saved than health and
peace of mind.</p>
<p>To this day I do not know where to find a weapon strong enough
to subdue the tendency to impurity in young men; and although I
cannot tell them what I do not believe, I hanker sometimes after
the old prohibitions and penalties.&nbsp; Physiological penalties
are too remote, and the subtler penalties&mdash;the degradation,
the growth of callousness to finer pleasures, the loss of
sensitiveness to all that is most nobly attractive in
woman&mdash;are too feeble to withstand temptation when it lies
in ambush like a garrotter, and has the reason stunned in a
moment.</p>
<p>The only thing that can be done is to make the conscience of a
boy generally tender, so that he shrinks instinctively from the
monstrous injustice of contributing for the sake of his own
pleasure to the ruin of another.&nbsp; As soon as manhood dawns,
he must also have his attention absorbed on some object which
will divert his thoughts intellectually or ideally; and by slight
yet constant pressure, exercised not by fits and starts, but day
after day, directly and indirectly, his father must form an
antipathy in him to brutish, selfish sensuality.&nbsp; Above all,
there must be no toying with passion, and no books permitted,
without condemnation and warning, which are not of a heroic
turn.&nbsp; When the boy becomes a man he may read Byron without
danger.&nbsp; To a youth he is fatal.</p>
<p>Before leaving this subject I may observe, that parents
greatly err by not telling their children a good many things
which they ought to know.&nbsp; Had I been taught when I was
young a few facts about myself, which I only learned accidentally
long afterwards, a good deal of misery might have been spared
me.</p>
<p>Nothing particular happened to me till I was about fourteen,
when I was told it was time I became converted.&nbsp; Conversion,
amongst the Independents and other Puritan sects, is supposed to
be a kind of miracle wrought in the heart by the influence of the
Holy Spirit, by which the man becomes something altogether
different to what he was previously.&nbsp; It affects, or should
affect, his character; that is to say, he ought after conversion
to be better in every way than he was before; but this is not
considered as its main consequence.&nbsp; In its essence it is a
change in the emotions and increased vividness of belief.&nbsp;
It is now altogether untrue.&nbsp; Yet it is an undoubted fact
that in earlier days, and, indeed, in rare cases, as late as the
time of my childhood, it was occasionally a reality.</p>
<p>It is possible to imagine that under the preaching of Paul
sudden conviction of a life misspent may have been produced with
sudden personal attachment to the Galilean who, until then, had
been despised.&nbsp; There may have been prompt release of
unsuspected powers, and as prompt an imprisonment for ever of
meaner weaknesses and tendencies; the result being literally a
putting off of the old, and a putting on of the new man.&nbsp;
Love has always been potent to produce such a transformation, and
the exact counterpart of conversion, as it was understood by the
apostles, may be seen whenever a man is redeemed from vice by
attachment to some woman whom he worships, or when a girl is
reclaimed from idleness and vanity by becoming a mother.</p>
<p>But conversion, as it was understood by me and as it is now
understood, is altogether unmeaning.&nbsp; I knew that I had to
be &ldquo;a child of God,&rdquo; and after a time professed
myself to be one, but I cannot call to mind that I was anything
else than I always had been, save that I was perhaps a little
more hypocritical; not in the sense that I professed to others
what I knew I did not believe, but in the sense that I professed
it to myself.&nbsp; I was obliged to declare myself convinced of
sin; convinced of the efficacy of the atonement; convinced that I
was forgiven; convinced that the Holy Ghost was shed abroad in my
heart; and convinced of a great many other things which were the
merest phrases.</p>
<p>However, the end of it was, that I was proposed for
acceptance, and two deacons were deputed, in accordance with the
usual custom, to wait upon me and ascertain my fitness for
membership.&nbsp; What they said and what I said has now
altogether vanished; but I remember with perfect distinctness the
day on which I was admitted.&nbsp; It was the custom to demand of
each candidate a statement of his or her experience.&nbsp; I had
no experience to give; and I was excused on the grounds that I
had been the child of pious parents, and consequently had not
undergone that convulsion which those, not favoured like myself,
necessarily underwent when they were called.</p>
<p>I was now expected to attend all those extra services which
were specially for the church.&nbsp; I stayed to the late
prayer-meeting on Sunday; I went to the prayer-meeting on
week-days, and also to private prayer-meetings.&nbsp; These
services were not interesting to me for their own sake.&nbsp; I
thought they were, but what I really liked was clanship and the
satisfaction of belonging to a society marked off from the great
world.</p>
<p>It must also be added that the evening meetings afforded us
many opportunities for walking home with certain young women,
who, I am sorry to say, were a more powerful attraction, not to
me only, but to others, than the prospect of hearing brother
Holderness, the travelling draper, confess crimes which, to say
the truth, although they were many according to his own account,
were never given in that detail which would have made his
confession of some value.&nbsp; He never prayed without telling
all of us that there was no health in him, and that his soul was
a mass of putrefying sores; but everybody thought the better of
him for his self-humiliation.&nbsp; One actual indiscretion,
however, brought home to him would have been visited by
suspension or expulsion.</p>

33</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PREPARATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was necessary that an occupation
should be found for me, and after much deliberation it was
settled that I should &ldquo;go into the ministry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
had joined the church, I had &ldquo;engaged in prayer&rdquo;
publicly, and although I had not set up for being extraordinarily
pious, I was thought to be as good as most of the young men who
professed to have a mission to regenerate mankind.</p>
<p>Accordingly, after some months of preparation, I was taken to
a Dissenting College not very far from where we lived.&nbsp; It
was a large old-fashioned house with a newer building annexed,
and was surrounded with a garden and with meadows.&nbsp; Each
student had a separate room, and all had their meals together in
a common hall.&nbsp; Altogether there were about forty of
us.&nbsp; The establishment consisted of a President, an elderly
gentleman who had an American degree of doctor of divinity, and
who taught the various branches of theology.&nbsp; He was
assisted by three professors, who imparted to us as much Greek,
Latin, and mathematics as it was considered that we ought to
know.&nbsp; Behold me, then, beginning a course of training which
was to prepare me to meet the doubts of the nineteenth century;
to be the guide of men; to advise them in their perplexities; to
suppress their tempestuous lusts; to lift them above their petty
cares, and to lead them heavenward!</p>
<p>About the Greek and Latin and the secular part of the college
discipline I will say nothing, except that it was generally
inefficient.&nbsp; The theological and Biblical teaching was a
sham.&nbsp; We had come to the college in the first place to
learn the Bible.&nbsp; Our whole existence was in future to be
based upon that book; our lives were to be passed in preaching
it.&nbsp; I will venture to say that there was no book less
understood either by students or professors.&nbsp; The President
had a course of lectures, delivered year after year to successive
generations of his pupils, upon its authenticity and
inspiration.&nbsp; They were altogether remote from the subject;
and afterwards, when I came to know what the difficulties of
belief really were, I found that these essays, which were
supposed to be a triumphant confutation of the sceptic, were a
mere sword of lath.&nbsp; They never touched the question, and if
any doubts suggested themselves to the audience, nobody dared to
give them tongue, lest the expression of them should beget a
suspicion of heresy.</p>
<p>I remember also some lectures on the proof of the existence of
God and on the argument from design; all of which, when my mind
was once awakened, were as irrelevant as the chattering of
sparrows.&nbsp; When I did not even know who or what this God
was, and could not bring my lips to use the word with any mental
honesty, of what service was the &ldquo;watch argument&rdquo; to
me?&nbsp; Very lightly did the President pass over all these
initial difficulties of his religion.&nbsp; I see him now, a
gentleman with lightish hair, with a most mellifluous voice and a
most pastoral manner, reading his prim little tracts to us
directed against the &ldquo;shallow infidel&rdquo; who seemed to
deny conclusions so obvious that we were certain he could not be
sincere, and those of us who had never seen an infidel might well
be pardoned for supposing that he must always be wickedly
blind.</p>
<p>About a dozen of these tracts settled the infidel and the
whole mass of unbelief from the time of Celsus downwards.&nbsp;
The President&rsquo;s task was all the easier because he knew
nothing of German literature; and, indeed, the word
&ldquo;German&rdquo; was a term of reproach signifying something
very awful, although nobody knew exactly what it was.</p>
<p>Systematic theology was the next science to which the
President directed us.&nbsp; We used a sort of Calvinistic manual
which began by setting forth that mankind was absolutely in
God&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; He was our maker, and we had no legal
claim whatever to any consideration from Him.&nbsp; The author
then mechanically built up the Calvinistic creed, step by step,
like a house of cards.&nbsp; Systematic theology was the great
business of our academical life.&nbsp; We had to read sermons to
the President in class, and no sermon was considered complete and
proper unless it unfolded what was called the scheme of
redemption from beginning to end.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that about the Bible, as I have already
said, we were in darkness.&nbsp; It was a magazine of texts, and
those portions of it which contributed nothing in the shape of
texts, or formed no part of the scheme, were neglected.&nbsp;
Worse still, not a word was ever spoken to us telling us in what
manner to strengthen the reason, to subdue the senses, or in what
way to deal with all the varied diseases of that soul of man
which we were to set ourselves to save.&nbsp; All its failings,
infinitely more complicated than those of the body, were grouped
as &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; and for these there was one quack
remedy.&nbsp; If the patient did not like the remedy, or got no
good from it, the fault was his.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the scheme was never of the slightest
service to me in repressing one solitary evil inclination; at no
point did it come into contact with me.&nbsp; At the time it
seemed right and proper that I should learn it, and I had no
doubt of its efficacy; but when the stress of temptation was upon
me, it never occurred to me, nor when I became a minister did I
find it sufficiently powerful to mend the most trifling
fault.&nbsp; In after years, but not till I had strayed far away
from the President and his creed, the Bible was really opened to
me, and became to me, what it now is, the most precious of
books.</p>
<p>There were several small chapels scattered in the villages
near the college, and these chapels were &ldquo;supplied,&rdquo;
as the phrase is, by the students.&nbsp; Those who were near the
end of their course were also employed as substitutes for regular
ministers when they were temporarily absent.&nbsp; Sometimes a
senior was even sent up to London to take the place, on a sudden
emergency, of a great London minister, and when he came back he
was an object almost of adoration.&nbsp; The congregation, on the
other hand, consisting in some part of country people spending a
Sunday in town and anxious to hear a celebrated preacher, were
not at all disposed to adore, when, instead of the great man,
they saw &ldquo;only a student.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time I was nineteen I took my turn in
&ldquo;supplying&rdquo; the villages, and set forth with the
utmost confidence what appeared to me to be the indubitable
gospel.&nbsp; No shadow of a suspicion of its truth ever crossed
my mind, and yet I had not spent an hour in comprehending, much
less in answering, one objection to it.&nbsp; The objections, in
fact, had never met me; they were over my horizon
altogether.&nbsp; It is wonderful to think how I could take so
much for granted; and not merely take it to myself and for
myself, but proclaim it as a message to other people.&nbsp; It
would be a mistake, however, to suppose that theological youths
are the only class who are guilty of such presumption.&nbsp; Our
gregarious instinct is so strong that it is the most difficult
thing for us to be satisfied with suspended judgment.&nbsp; Men
must join a party, and have a cry, and they generally take up
their party and their cry from the most indifferent motives.</p>
<p>For my own part I cannot be enthusiastic about politics,
except on rare occasions when the issue is a very narrow
one.&nbsp; There is so much that requires profound examination,
and it disgusts me to get upon a platform and dispute with ardent
Radicals or Conservatives who know nothing about even the
rudiments of history, political economy, or political philosophy,
without which it is as absurd to have an opinion upon what are
called politics as it would be to have an opinion upon an
astronomical problem without having learned Euclid.</p>
<p>The more incapable we are of thorough investigations, the
wider and deeper are the subjects upon which we busy ourselves,
and still more strange, the more bigoted do we become in our
conclusions about them; and yet it is not strange, for he who by
painful processes has found yes and no alternate for so long that
he is not sure which is final, is the last man in the world, if
he for the present is resting in yes, to crucify another who can
get no further than no.&nbsp; The bigot is he to whom no such
painful processes have ever been permitted.</p>
<p>The society amongst the students was very poor.&nbsp; Not a
single friendship formed then has remained with me.&nbsp; They
were mostly young men of no education, who had been taken from
the counter, and their spiritual life was not very deep.&nbsp; In
many of them it did not even exist, and their whole attention was
absorbed upon their chances of getting wealthy congregations or
of making desirable matches.&nbsp; It was a time in which the
world outside was seething with the ferment which had been cast
into it by Germany and by those in England whom Germany had
influenced, but not a fragment of it had dropped within our
walls.&nbsp; I cannot call to mind a single conversation upon any
but the most trivial topics, nor did our talk ever turn even upon
our religion, so far as it was a thing affecting the soul, but
upon it as something subsidiary to chapels, &ldquo;causes,&rdquo;
deacons, and the like.</p>
<p>The emptiness of some of my colleagues, and their worldliness,
too, were almost incredible.&nbsp; There was one who was
particularly silly.&nbsp; He was a blond youth with greyish eyes,
a mouth not quite shut, and an eternal simper upon his
face.&nbsp; He never had an idea in his head, and never read
anything except the denominational newspapers and a few
well-known aids to sermonising.&nbsp; He was a great man at all
tea-meetings, anniversaries, and parties.&nbsp; He was facile in
public speaking, and he dwelt much upon the joys of heaven and
upon such topics as the possibility of our recognising one
another there.&nbsp; I have known him describe for twenty
minutes, in a kind of watery rhetoric, the passage of the soul to
bliss through death, and its meeting in the next world with those
who had gone before.</p>
<p>With all his weakness he was close and mean in money matters,
and when he left college, the first thing he did was to marry a
widow with a fortune.&nbsp; Before long he became one of the most
popular of ministers in a town much visited by sick persons, with
whom he was an especial favourite.&nbsp; I disliked him&mdash;and
specially disliked his unpleasant behaviour to women.&nbsp; If I
had been a woman, I should have spurned him for his perpetual
insult of inane compliments.&nbsp; He was always dawdling after
&ldquo;the sex,&rdquo; which was one of his sweet phrases, and
yet he was not passionate.&nbsp; Passion does not dawdle and
compliment, nor is it nasty, as this fellow was.&nbsp; Passion
may burn like a devouring flame; and in a few moments, like
flame, may bring down a temple to dust and ashes, but it is
earnest as flame, and essentially pure.</p>
<p>During the first two years at college my life was entirely
external.&nbsp; My heart was altogether untouched by anything I
heard, read, or did, although I myself supposed that I took an
interest in them.&nbsp; But one day in my third year, a day I
remember as well as Paul must have remembered afterwards the day
on which he went to Damascus, I happened to find amongst a parcel
of books a volume of poems in paper boards.&nbsp; It was called
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, and I read first one and then the whole
book.&nbsp; It conveyed to me no new doctrine, and yet the change
it wrought in me could only be compared with that which is said
to have been wrought on Paul himself by the Divine
apparition.</p>
<p>Looking over the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> again, as I have
looked over it a dozen times since then, I can hardly see what it
was which stirred me so powerfully, nor do I believe that it
communicated much to me which could be put in words.&nbsp; But it
excited a movement and a growth which went on till, by degrees,
all the systems which enveloped me like a body gradually decayed
from me and fell away into nothing.&nbsp; Of more importance,
too, than the decay of systems was the birth of a habit of inner
reference and a dislike to occupy myself with anything which did
not in some way or other touch the soul, or was not the
illustration or embodiment of some spiritual law.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a definite explanation to be given of one
effect produced by the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>.&nbsp; God is
nowhere formally deposed, and Wordsworth would have been the last
man to say that he had lost his faith in the God of his
fathers.&nbsp; But his real God is not the God of the Church, but
the God of the hills, the abstraction Nature, and to this my
reverence was transferred.&nbsp; Instead of an object of worship
which was altogether artificial, remote, never coming into
genuine contact with me, I had now one which I thought to be
real, one in which literally I could live and move and have my
being, an actual fact present before my eyes.&nbsp; God was
brought from that heaven of the books, and dwelt on the downs in
the far-away distances, and in every cloud-shadow which wandered
across the valley.&nbsp; Wordsworth unconsciously did for me what
every religious reformer has done&mdash;he re-created my Supreme
Divinity; substituting a new and living spirit for the old deity,
once alive, but gradually hardened into an idol.</p>
<p>What days were those of the next few years before increasing
age had presented preciser problems and demanded preciser
answers; before all joy was darkened by the shadow of on-coming
death, and when life seemed infinite!&nbsp; Those were the days
when through the whole long summer&rsquo;s morning I wanted no
companion but myself, provided only I was in the country, and
when books were read with tears in the eyes.&nbsp; Those were the
days when mere life, apart from anything which it brings, was
exquisite.</p>
<p>In my own college I found no sympathy, but we were in the
habit of meeting occasionally the students from other colleges,
and amongst them I met with one or two, especially one who had
undergone experiences similar to my own.&nbsp; The friendships
formed with these young men have lasted till now, and have been
the most permanent of all the relationships of my
existence.&nbsp; I wish not to judge others, but the persons who
to me have proved themselves most attractive, have been those who
have passed through such a process as that through which I myself
passed; those who have had in some form or other an enthusiastic
stage in their history, when the story of Genesis and of the
Gospels has been rewritten, when God has visibly walked in the
garden, and the Son of God has drawn men away from their daily
occupations into the divinest of dreams.</p>
<p>I have known men&mdash;most interesting men with far greater
powers than any which I have possessed, men who have never been
trammelled by a false creed, who have devoted themselves to
science and acquired a great reputation, who have somehow never
laid hold upon me like the man I have just mentioned.&nbsp; He
failed altogether as a minister, and went back to his shop, but
the old glow of his youth burns, and will burn, for ever.&nbsp;
When I am with him our conversation naturally turns on matters
which are of profoundest importance: with others it may be
instructive, but I leave them unmoved, and I trace the difference
distinctly to that visitation, for it was nothing else, which
came to him in his youth.</p>
<p>The effect which was produced upon my preaching and daily
conversation by this change was immediate.&nbsp; It became
gradually impossible for me to talk about subjects which had not
some genuine connection with me, or to desire to hear others talk
about them.&nbsp; The artificial, the merely miraculous, the
event which had no inner meaning, no matter how large externally
it might be, I did not care for.&nbsp; A little Greek
mythological story was of more importance to me than a war which
filled the newspapers.&nbsp; What, then, could I do with my
theological treatises?</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that I immediately
became formally heretical.&nbsp; Nearly every doctrine in the
college creed had once had a natural origin in the necessities of
human nature, and might therefore be so interpreted as to become
a necessity again.&nbsp; To reach through to that original
necessity; to explain the atonement as I believed it appeared to
Paul, and the sinfulness of man as it appeared to the prophets,
was my object.&nbsp; But it was precisely this reaching after a
meaning which constituted heresy.&nbsp; The distinctive essence
of our orthodoxy was not this or that dogma, but the acceptance
of dogmas as communications from without, and not as born from
within.</p>
<p>Heresy began, and in fact was altogether present, when I said
to myself that a mere statement of the atonement as taught in
class was impossible for me, and that I must go back to Paul and
his century, place myself in his position, and connect the
atonement through him with something which I felt.&nbsp; I thus
continued to use all the terms which I had hitherto used; but an
uneasy feeling began to develop itself about me in the minds of
the professors, because I did not rest in the
&ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; of the gospel.&nbsp; To me this meant
its unintelligibility.</p>
<p>I remember, for example, discoursing about the death of
Christ.&nbsp; There was not a single word which was ordinarily
used in the pulpit which I did not use&mdash;satisfaction for
sin, penalty, redeeming blood, they were all there&mdash;but I
began by saying that in this world there was no redemption for
man but by blood; furthermore, the innocent had everywhere and in
all time to suffer for the guilty.&nbsp; It had been objected
that it was contrary to our notion of an all-loving Being that He
should demand such a sacrifice; but, contrary or not, in this
world it was true, quite apart from Jesus, that virtue was
martyred every day, unknown and unconsoled, in order that the
wicked might somehow be saved.&nbsp; This was part of the scheme
of the world, and we might dislike it or not, we could not get
rid of it.&nbsp; The consequences of my sin, moreover, are
rendered less terrible by virtues not my own.&nbsp; I am
literally saved from penalties because another pays the penalty
for me.&nbsp; The atonement, and what it accomplished for man,
were therefore a sublime summing up as it were of what sublime
men have to do for their race; an exemplification, rather than a
contradiction, of Nature herself, as we know her in our own
experience.</p>
<p>Now, all this was really intended as a defence of the
atonement; but the President heard me that Sunday, and on the
Monday he called me into his room.&nbsp; He said that my sermon
was marked by considerable ability, but he should have been
better satisfied if I had confined myself to setting forth as
plainly as I could the &ldquo;way of salvation&rdquo; as revealed
in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; What I had urged might perhaps have
possessed some interest for cultivated people; in fact, he had
himself urged pretty much the same thing many years ago, when he
was a young man, in a sermon he had preached at the Union
meeting; but I must recollect that in all probability my sphere
of usefulness would lie amongst humble hearers, perhaps in an
agricultural village or a small town, and that he did not think
people of this sort would understand me if I talked over their
heads as I had done the day before.&nbsp; What they wanted on a
Sunday, after all the cares of the week, was not anything to
perplex and disturb them; not anything which demanded any
exercise of thought; but a repetition of the &ldquo;old story of
which, Mr. Rutherford, you know, we never ought to get weary; an
exhibition of our exceeding sinfulness; of our safety in the Rock
of Ages, and there only; of the joys of the saints and the
sufferings of those who do not believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words fell on me like the hand of a corpse, and I went
away much depressed.&nbsp; My sermon had excited me, and the man
who of all men ought to have welcomed me, had not a word of
warmth or encouragement for me, nothing but the coldest
indifference, and even repulse.</p>
<p>It occurs to me here to offer an explanation of a failing of
which I have been accused in later years, and that is secrecy and
reserve.&nbsp; The real truth is, that nobody more than myself
could desire self-revelation; but owing to peculiar tendencies in
me, and peculiarity of education, I was always prone to say
things in conversation which I found produced blank silence in
the majority of those who listened to me, and immediate
opportunity was taken by my hearers to turn to something
trivial.&nbsp; Hence it came to pass that only when tempted by
unmistakable sympathy could I be induced to express my real self
on any topic of importance.</p>
<p>It is a curious instance of the difficulty of diagnosing (to
use a doctor&rsquo;s word) any spiritual disease, if disease this
shyness may be called.&nbsp; People would ordinarily set it down
to self-reliance, with no healthy need of intercourse.&nbsp; It
was nothing of the kind.&nbsp; It was an excess of
communicativeness, an eagerness to show what was most at my
heart, and to ascertain what was at the heart of those to whom I
talked, which made me incapable of mere fencing and trifling, and
so often caused me to retreat into myself when I found absolute
absense of response.</p>
<p>I am also reminded here of a dream which I had in these years
of a perfect friendship.&nbsp; I always felt that, talk with whom
I would, I left something unsaid which was precisely what I most
wished to say.&nbsp; I wanted a friend who would sacrifice
himself to me utterly, and to whom I might offer a similar
sacrifice.&nbsp; I found companions for whom I cared, and who
professed to care for me; but I was thirsting for deeper draughts
of love than any which they had to offer; and I said to myself
that if I were to die, not one of them would remember me for more
than a week.&nbsp; This was not selfishness, for I longed to
prove my devotion as well as to receive that of another.&nbsp;
How this ideal haunted me!&nbsp; It made me restless and anxious
at the sight of every new face, wondering whether at last I had
found that for which I searched as if for the kingdom of
heaven.</p>
<p>It is superfluous to say that a friend of the kind I wanted
never appeared, and disappointment after disappointment at last
produced in me a cynicism which repelled people from me, and
brought upon me a good deal of suffering.&nbsp; I tried men by my
standard, and if they did not come up to it I rejected them; thus
I prodigally wasted a good deal of the affection which the world
would have given me.&nbsp; Only when I got much older did I
discern the duty of accepting life as God has made it, and
thankfully receiving any scrap of love offered to me, however
imperfect it might be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any mistake which I have made which has
cost me more than this; but at the same time I must record that
it was a mistake for which, considering everything, I cannot much
blame myself.&nbsp; I hope it is amended now.&nbsp; Now when it
is getting late I recognise a higher obligation, brought home to
me by a closer study of the New Testament.&nbsp; Sympathy or no
sympathy, a man&rsquo;s love should no more fail towards his
fellows than that love which spent itself on disciples who
altogether misunderstood it, like the rain which falls on just
and unjust alike.</p>

57</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WATER LANE</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> now reached the end of my
fourth year at college, and it was time for me to leave.&nbsp; I
was sent down into the eastern counties to a congregation which
had lost its minister, and was there &ldquo;on probation&rdquo;
for a month.&nbsp; I was naturally a good speaker, and as the
&ldquo;cause&rdquo; had got very low, the attendance at the
chapel increased during the month I was there.&nbsp; The deacons
thought they had a prospect of returning prosperity, and in the
end I received a nearly unanimous invitation, which, after some
hesitation, I accepted.&nbsp; One of the deacons, a Mr. Snale,
was against me; he thought I was not &ldquo;quite sound&rdquo;;
but he was overruled.&nbsp; We shall hear more of him
presently.&nbsp; After a short holiday I entered on my new
duties.</p>
<p>The town was one of those which are not uncommon in that part
of the world.&nbsp; It had a population of about seven or eight
thousand, and was a sort of condensation of the agricultural
country round.&nbsp; There was one main street, consisting
principally of very decent, respectable shops.&nbsp; Generally
speaking, there were two shops of each trade; one which was
patronised by the Church and Tories, and another by the
Dissenters and Whigs.&nbsp; The inhabitants were divided into two
distinct camps&mdash;of the Church and Tory camp the other camp
knew nothing.&nbsp; On the other hand, the knowledge which each
member of the Dissenting camp had of every other member was most
intimate.</p>
<p>The Dissenters were further split up into two or three
different sects, but the main sect was that of the
Independents.&nbsp; They, in fact, dominated every other.&nbsp;
There was a small Baptist community, and the Wesleyans had a new
red-brick chapel in the outskirts; but for some reason or other
the Independents were really the Dissenters, and until the
&ldquo;cause&rdquo; had dwindled, as before observed, all the
Dissenters of any note were to be found on Sunday in their
meeting-house in Water Lane.</p>
<p>My predecessor had died in harness at the age of
seventy-five.&nbsp; I never knew him, but from all I could hear
he must have been a man of some power.&nbsp; As he got older,
however, he became feeble; and after a course of three sermons on
a Sunday for fifty years, what he had to say was so entirely
anticipated by his congregation, that although they all
maintained that the gospel, or, in other words, the doctrine of
the fall, the atonement, and so forth, should continually be
presented, and their minister also believed and acted implicitly
upon the same theory, they fell away&mdash;some to the Baptists,
some to the neighbouring Independents about two miles off, and
some to the Church, while a few &ldquo;went nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I came I found that the deacons still remained
true.&nbsp; They were the skeleton; but the flesh was so woefully
emaciated, that on my first Sunday there were not above fifty
persons in a building which would hold seven hundred.&nbsp; These
deacons were four in number.&nbsp; One was an old farmer who
lived in a village three miles distant.&nbsp; Ever since he was a
boy he had driven over to Water Lane on Sunday.&nbsp; He and his
family brought their dinner with them, and ate it in the vestry;
but they never stopped till the evening, because of the
difficulty of getting home on dark nights, and because they all
went to bed in winter-time at eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Morning and afternoon Mr. Catfield&mdash;for that was his
name&mdash;gave out the hymns.&nbsp; He was a plain, honest man,
very kind, very ignorant, never reading any book except the
Bible, and barely a newspaper save <i>Bell&rsquo;s Weekly
Messenger</i>.&nbsp; Even about the Bible he knew little or
nothing beyond a few favourite chapters; and I am bound to say
that, so far as my experience goes, the character so frequently
drawn in romances of intense Bible students in Dissenting
congregations is very rare.&nbsp; At the same time Mr. Catfield
believed himself to be very orthodox, and in his way was very
pious.&nbsp; I could never call him a hypocrite.&nbsp; He was as
sincere as he could be, and yet no religious expression of his
was ever so sincere as the most ordinary expression of the most
trifling pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>The second deacon, Mr. Weeley, was, as he described himself, a
builder and undertaker; more properly an undertaker and
carpenter.&nbsp; He was a thin, tall man, with a tenor voice, and
he set the tunes.&nbsp; He was entirely without energy of any
kind, and always seemed oppressed by a world which was too much
for him.&nbsp; He had depended a good deal for custom upon his
chapel connection; and when the attendance at the chapel fell
off, his trade fell off likewise, so that he had to compound with
his creditors.&nbsp; He was a mere shadow, a man of whom nothing
could be said either good or evil.</p>
<p>The third deacon was Mr. Snale, the draper.&nbsp; When I first
knew him he was about thirty-five.&nbsp; He was slim, small, and
small-faced, closely shaven, excepting a pair of little curly
whiskers, and he was extremely neat.&nbsp; He had a little voice
too, rather squeaky, and the marked peculiarity that he hardly
ever said anything, no matter how disagreeable it might be,
without stretching as if in a smile his thin little lips.&nbsp;
He kept the principal draper&rsquo;s shop in the town, and even
Church people spent their money with him, because he was so very
genteel compared with the other draper, who was a great red man,
and hung things outside his window.&nbsp; Mr. Snale was married,
had children, and was strictly proper.&nbsp; But his way of
talking to women and about them was more odious than the way of a
debauchee.&nbsp; He invariably called them &ldquo;the
ladies,&rdquo; or more exactly, &ldquo;the leedies&rdquo;; and he
hardly ever spoke to a &ldquo;leedy&rdquo; without a smirk and
some faint attempt at a joke.</p>
<p>One of the customs of the chapel was what were called Dorcas
meetings.&nbsp; Once a month the wives and daughters drank tea
with each other; the evening being ostensibly devoted to making
clothes for the poor.&nbsp; The husband of the lady who gave the
entertainment for the month had to wait upon the company, and the
minister was expected to read to them while they worked.</p>
<p>It was my lot to be Mr. Snale&rsquo;s guest two or three times
when Mrs. Snale was the Dorcas hostess.&nbsp; We met in the
drawing-room, which was over the shop, and looked out into the
town market-place.&nbsp; There was a round table in the middle of
the room, at which Mrs. Snale sat and made the tea.&nbsp;
Abundance of hot buttered toast and muffins were provided, which
Mr. Snale and a maid handed round to the party.</p>
<p>Four pictures decorated the walls.&nbsp; One hung over the
mantelpiece.&nbsp; It was a portrait in oils of Mr. Snale, and
opposite to it, on the other side, was a portrait of Mrs.
Snale.&nbsp; Both were daubs, but curiously faithful in depicting
what was most offensive in the character of both the originals,
Mr. Snale&rsquo;s simper being preserved; together with the
peculiarly hard, heavy sensuality of the eye in Mrs. Snale, who
was large and full-faced, correct like Mr. Snale, a member of the
church, a woman whom I never saw moved to any generosity, and
cruel not with the ferocity of the tiger, but with the dull
insensibility of a cartwheel, which will roll over a man&rsquo;s
neck as easily as over a flint.&nbsp; The third picture
represented the descent of the Holy Ghost; a number of persons
sitting in a chamber, and each one with the flame of a candle on
his head.&nbsp; The fourth represented the last day.&nbsp; The
Son of God was in a chair surrounded by clouds, and beside Him
was a flying figure blowing a long mail-coach horn.&nbsp; The
dead were coming up out of their graves; some were half out of
the earth, others three-parts out&mdash;the whole of the bottom
part of the picture being filled with bodies emerging from the
ground, a few looking happy, but most of them very wretched; all
of them being naked.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Mrs. Snale&rsquo;s Dorcas gathering
Mr. Snale was reader, on the ground that I was a novice; and I
was very glad to resign the task to him.&nbsp; As the business in
hand was week-day and secular, it was not considered necessary
that the selected subjects should be religious; but as it was
distinctly connected with the chapel, it was also considered that
they should have a religious flavour.&nbsp; Consequently the
Bible was excluded, and so were books on topics altogether
worldly.&nbsp; Dorcas meetings were generally, therefore, shut up
to the denominational journal and to magazines.&nbsp; Towards the
end of the evening Mr. Snale read the births, deaths, and
marriages in this journal.&nbsp; It would not have been thought
right to read them from any other newspaper, but it was agreed,
with a fineness of tact which was very remarkable, that it was
quite right to read them in one which was
&ldquo;serious.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the whole time that the
reading was going on conversation was not arrested, but was
conducted in a kind of half whisper; and this was another reason
why I exceedingly disliked to read, for I could never endure to
speak if people did not listen.</p>
<p>At half-past eight the work was put away, and Mrs. Snale went
to the piano and played a hymn tune, the minister having first of
all selected the hymn.&nbsp; Singing over, he offered a short
prayer, and the company separated.&nbsp; Supper was not served,
as it was found to be too great an expense.&nbsp; The husbands of
the ladies generally came to escort them home, but did not come
upstairs.&nbsp; Some of the gentlemen waited below in the
dining-room, but most of them preferred the shop, for, although
it was shut, the gas was burning to enable the assistants to put
away the goods which had been got out during the day.</p>
<p>When it first became my turn to read I proposed the <i>Vicar
of Wakefield</i>; but although no objection was raised at the
time, Mr. Snale took an opportunity of telling me, after I had
got through a chapter or two, that he thought it would be better
if it were discontinued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because, you know, Mr.
Rutherford,&rdquo; he said, with his smirk, &ldquo;the company is
mixed; there are young leedies present, and perhaps, Mr.
Rutherford, a book with a more requisite tone might be more
suitable on such an occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; What he meant I did
not know, and how to find a book with a more requisite tone I did
not know.</p>
<p>However, the next time, in my folly, I tried a selection from
George Fox&rsquo;s Journal.&nbsp; Mr. Snale objected to this
too.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;hardly of a character adapted for social
intercourse,&rdquo; he thought; and furthermore, &ldquo;although
Mr. Fox might be a very good man, and was a converted character,
yet he did not, you know, Mr. Rutherford, belong to
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I was reduced to that class of literature
which of all others I most abominated, and which always seemed to
me the most profane&mdash;religious and sectarian gossip,
religious novels designed to make religion attractive, and other
slip-slop of this kind.&nbsp; I could not endure it, and was
frequently unwell on Dorcas evenings.</p>
<p>The rest of the small congregation was of no particular
note.&nbsp; As I have said before, it had greatly fallen away,
and all who remained clung to the chapel rather by force of habit
than from any other reason.&nbsp; The only exception was an old
maiden lady and her sister, who lived in a little cottage about a
mile out of the town.&nbsp; They were pious in the purest sense
of the word, suffering much from ill-health, but perfectly
resigned, and with a kind of tempered cheerfulness always
apparent on their faces, like the cheerfulness of a white sky
with a sun veiled by light and lofty clouds.&nbsp; They were the
daughters of a carriage-builder, who had left them a small
annuity.</p>
<p>Their house was one of the sweetest which I ever
entered.&nbsp; The moment I found myself inside it, I became
conscious of perfect repose.&nbsp; Everything was at rest; books,
pictures, furniture, all breathed the same peace.&nbsp; Nothing
in the house was new, but everything had been preserved with such
care that nothing looked old.&nbsp; Yet the owners were not what
is called old-maidish; that is to say, they were not
superstitious worshippers of order and neatness.</p>
<p>I remember Mrs. Snale&rsquo;s children coming in one afternoon
when I was there.&nbsp; They were rough and ill-mannered, and
left traces of dirty footmarks all over the carpet, which the two
ladies noticed at once.&nbsp; But it made no difference to the
treatment of the children, who had some cake and currant wine
given to them, and were sent away rejoicing.&nbsp; Directly they
had gone, the elder of my friends asked me if I would excuse her;
she would gather up the dirt before it was trodden about.&nbsp;
So she brought a dust-pan and brush (the little servant was out)
and patiently swept the floor.&nbsp; That was the way with
them.&nbsp; Did any mischief befall them or those whom they knew,
without blaming anybody, they immediately and noiselessly set
about repairing it with that silent promptitude of nature which
rebels not against a wound, but the very next instant begins her
work of protection and recovery.</p>
<p>The Misses Arbour (for that was their name) mixed but little
in the society of the town.&nbsp; They explained to me that their
health would not permit it.&nbsp; They read books&mdash;a
few&mdash;but they were not books about which I knew very much,
and they belonged altogether to an age preceding mine.&nbsp; Of
the names which had moved me, and of all the thoughts stirring in
the time, they had heard nothing.&nbsp; They greatly admired
Cowper, a poet who then did not much attract me.</p>
<p>The country near me was rather level, but towards the west it
rose into soft swelling hills, between which were pleasant
lanes.&nbsp; At about ten miles distant eastward was the
sea.&nbsp; A small river ran across the High Street under a stone
bridge; for about two miles below us it was locked up for the
sake of the mills, but at the end of the two miles it became
tidal and flowed between deep and muddy banks through marshes to
the ocean.&nbsp; Almost all my walks were by the river-bank down
to these marshes, and as far on as possible till the open water
was visible.&nbsp; Not that I did not like inland scenery: nobody
could like it more, but the sea was a corrective to the
littleness all round me.&nbsp; With the ships on it sailing to
the other end of the earth it seemed to connect me with the great
world outside the parochialism of the society in which I
lived.</p>
<p>Such was the town of C-, and such the company amidst which I
found myself.&nbsp; After my probation it was arranged that I
should begin my new duties at once, and accordingly I took
lodgings&mdash;two rooms over the shop of a tailor who acted as
chapel-keeper, pew-opener, and sexton.&nbsp; There was a small
endowment on the chapel of fifty pounds a year, and the rest of
my income was derived from the pew-rents, which at the time I
took charge did not exceed another seventy.</p>
<p>The first Sunday on which I preached after being accepted was
a dull day in November, but there was no dullness in me.&nbsp;
The congregation had increased a good deal during the past four
weeks, and I was stimulated by the prospect of the new life
before me.&nbsp; It seemed to be a fit opportunity to say
something generally about Christianity and its special
peculiarities.&nbsp; I began by pointing out that each philosophy
and religion which had arisen in the world was the answer to a
question earnestly asked at the time; it was a remedy proposed to
meet some extreme pressure.&nbsp; Religions and philosophies were
not created by idle people who sat down and said, &ldquo;Let us
build up a system of beliefs upon the universe; what shall we say
about immortality, about sin?&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; Unless
there had been antecedent necessity there could have been no
religion; and no problem of life or death could be solved except
under the weight of that necessity.&nbsp; The stoical morality
arose out of the condition of Rome when the scholar and the pious
man could do nothing but simply strengthen his knees and back to
bear an inevitable burden.&nbsp; He was forced to find some
counterpoise for the misery of poverty and persecution, and he
found it in the denial of their power to touch him.&nbsp; So with
Christianity.</p>
<p>Jesus was a poor solitary thinker, confronted by two enormous
and overpowering organisations&mdash;the Jewish hierarchy and the
Roman State.&nbsp; He taught the doctrine of the kingdom of
heaven; He trained Himself to have faith in the absolute monarchy
of the soul, the absolute monarchy of His own; He tells us that
each man should learn to find peace in his own thoughts, his own
visions.&nbsp; It is a most difficult thing to do; most difficult
to believe that my highest happiness consists in my perception of
whatever is beautiful.&nbsp; If I by myself watch the sun rise,
or the stars come out in the evening, or feel the love of man or
woman,&mdash;I ought to say to myself, &ldquo;There is nothing
beyond this.&rdquo;&nbsp; But people will not rest there; they
are not content, and they are for ever chasing a shadow which
flies before them, a something external which never brings what
it promises.</p>
<p>I said that Christianity was essentially the religion of the
unknown and of the lonely; of those who are not a success.&nbsp;
It was the religion of the man who goes through life thinking
much, but who makes few friends and sees nothing come of his
thoughts.&nbsp; I said a good deal more upon the same theme which
I have forgotten.</p>
<p>After the service was over I went down into the vestry.&nbsp;
Nobody came near me but my landlord, the chapel-keeper, who said
it was raining, and immediately went away to put out the lights
and shut up the building.&nbsp; I had no umbrella, and there was
nothing to be done but to walk out in the wet.&nbsp; When I got
home I found that my supper, consisting of bread and cheese with
a pint of beer, was on the table, but apparently it had been
thought unnecessary to light the fire again at that time of
night.&nbsp; I was overwrought, and paced about for hours in
hysterics.&nbsp; All that I had been preaching seemed the merest
vanity when I was brought face to face with the fact itself; and
I reproached myself bitterly that my own creed would not stand
the stress of an hour&rsquo;s actual trial.</p>
<p>Towards morning I got into bed, but not to sleep; and when the
dull daylight of Monday came, all support had vanished, and I
seemed to be sinking into a bottomless abyss.&nbsp; I became
gradually worse week by week, and my melancholy took a fixed
form.&nbsp; I got a notion into my head that my brain was
failing, and this was my first acquaintance with that most awful
malady hypochondria.&nbsp; I did not know then what I know now,
although I only half believe it practically, that this fixity of
form is a frequent symptom of the disease, and that the general
weakness manifests itself in a determinate horror, which
gradually fades with returning health.</p>
<p>For months&mdash;many months&mdash;this dreadful conviction of
coming idiocy or insanity lay upon me like some poisonous reptile
with its fangs driven into my very marrow, so that I could not
shake it off.&nbsp; It went with me wherever I went, it got up
with me in the morning, walked about with me all day, and lay
down with me at night.&nbsp; I managed, somehow or other, to do
my work, but I prayed incessantly for death; and to such a state
was I reduced that I could not even make the commonest
appointment for a day beforehand.&nbsp; The mere knowledge that
something had to be done agitated me and prevented my doing
it.</p>
<p>In June next year my holiday came, and I went away home to my
father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Father and mother were going, for the
first time in their lives, to spend a few days by the seaside
together, and I went with them to Ilfracombe.&nbsp; I had been
there about a week, when on one memorable morning, on the top of
one of those Devonshire hills, I became aware of a kind of flush
in the brain and a momentary relief such as I had not known since
that November night.&nbsp; I seemed, far away on the horizon, to
see just a rim of olive light low down under the edge of the
leaden cloud that hung over my head, a prophecy of the
restoration of the sun, or at least a witness that somewhere it
shone.&nbsp; It was not permanent, and perhaps the gloom was
never more profound, nor the agony more intense, than it was for
long after my Ilfracombe visit.&nbsp; But the light broadened,
and gradually the darkness was mitigated.&nbsp; I have never been
thoroughly restored.&nbsp; Often, with no warning, I am plunged
in the Valley of the Shadow, and no outlet seems possible; but I
contrive to traverse it, or to wait in calmness for access of
strength.</p>
<p>When I was at my worst I went to see a doctor.&nbsp; He
recommended me stimulants.&nbsp; I had always been rather
abstemious, and he thought I was suffering from physical
weakness.&nbsp; At first wine gave me relief, and such marked
relief that whenever I felt my misery insupportable I turned to
the bottle.&nbsp; At no time in my life was I ever the worse for
liquor, but I soon found the craving for it was getting the
better of me.&nbsp; I resolved never to touch it except at night,
and kept my vow; but the consequence was, that I looked forward
to the night, and waited for it with such eagerness that the day
seemed to exist only for the sake of the evening, when I might
hope at least for rest.&nbsp; For the wine as wine I cared
nothing; anything that would have dulled my senses would have
done just as well.</p>
<p>But now a new terror developed itself.&nbsp; I began to be
afraid that I was becoming a slave to alcohol; that the passion
for it would grow upon me, and that I should disgrace myself, and
die the most contemptible of all deaths.&nbsp; To a certain
extent my fears were just.&nbsp; The dose which was necessary to
procure temporary forgetfulness of my trouble had to be
increased, and might have increased dangerously.</p>
<p>But one day, feeling more than usual the tyranny of my master,
I received strength to make a sudden resolution to cast him off
utterly.&nbsp; Whatever be the consequence, I said, I will not be
the victim of this shame.&nbsp; If I am to go down to the grave,
it shall be as a man, and I will bear what I have to bear
honestly and without resort to the base evasion of
stupefaction.&nbsp; So that night I went to bed having drunk
nothing but water.&nbsp; The struggle was not felt just
then.&nbsp; It came later, when the first enthusiasm of a new
purpose had faded away, and I had to fall back on mere force of
will.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think anybody but those who have gone
through such a crisis can comprehend what it is.&nbsp; I never
understood the maniacal craving which is begotten by ardent
spirits, but I understood enough to be convinced that the man who
has once rescued himself from the domination even of half a
bottle, or three-parts of a bottle of claret daily, may assure
himself that there is nothing more in life to be done which he
need dread.</p>
<p>Two or three remarks begotten of experience in this matter
deserve record.&nbsp; One is, that the most powerful inducement
to abstinence, in my case, was the interference of wine with
liberty, and above all things its interference with what I really
loved best, and the transference of desire from what was most
desirable to what was sensual and base.&nbsp; The morning,
instead of being spent in quiet contemplation and quiet
pleasures, was spent in degrading anticipations.&nbsp; What
enabled me to conquer, was not so much heroism as a
susceptibility to nobler joys, and the difficulty which a man
must encounter who is not susceptible to them must be enormous
and almost insuperable.&nbsp; Pity, profound pity, is his due,
and especially if he happen to possess a nervous, emotional
organisation.&nbsp; If we want to make men water-drinkers, we
must first of all awaken in them a capacity for being tempted by
delights which water-drinking intensifies.&nbsp; The mere
preaching of self-denial will do little or no good.</p>
<p>Another observation is, that there is no danger in stopping at
once, and suddenly, the habit of drinking.&nbsp; The prisons and
asylums furnish ample evidence upon that point, but there will be
many an hour of exhaustion in which this danger will be simulated
and wine will appear the proper remedy.&nbsp; No man, or at least
very few men, would ever feel any desire for it soon after
sleep.&nbsp; This shows the power of repose, and I would advise
anybody who may be in earnest in this matter to be specially on
guard during moments of physical fatigue, and to try the effect
of eating and rest.&nbsp; Do not persist in a blind, obstinate
wrestle.&nbsp; Simply take food, drink water, go to bed, and so
conquer not by brute strength, but by strategy.</p>
<p>Going back to hypochondria and its countless forms of agony,
let it be borne in mind that the first thing to be aimed at is
patience&mdash;not to get excited with fears, not to dread the
evil which most probably will never arrive, but to sit down
quietly and <i>wait</i>.&nbsp; The simpler and less stimulating
the diet, the more likely it is that the sufferer will be able to
watch through the wakeful hours without delirium, and the less
likely is it that the general health will be impaired.&nbsp; Upon
this point of health too much stress cannot be laid.&nbsp; It is
difficult for the victim to believe that his digestion has
anything to do with a disease which seems so purely spiritual,
but frequently the misery will break up and yield, if it do not
altogether disappear, by a little attention to physiology and by
a change of air.&nbsp; As time wears on, too, mere duration will
be a relief; for it familiarises with what at first was strange
and insupportable, it shows the groundlessness of fears, and it
enables us to say with each new paroxysm, that we have surmounted
one like it before, and probably a worse.</p>

84</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EDWARD GIBBON MARDON</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> now been
&ldquo;settled,&rdquo; to use a Dissenting phrase, for nearly
eighteen months.&nbsp; While I was ill I had no heart in my work,
and the sermons I preached were very poor and excited no
particular suspicion.&nbsp; But with gradually returning energy
my love of reading revived, and questions which had slumbered
again presented themselves.&nbsp; I continued for some time to
deal with them as I had dealt with the atonement at
college.&nbsp; I said that Jesus was the true Paschal Lamb, for
that by His death men were saved from their sins, and from the
consequences of them; I said that belief in Christ, that is to
say, a love for Him, was more powerful to redeem men than the
works of the law.&nbsp; All this may have been true, but truth
lies in relation.&nbsp; It was not true when I, understanding
what I understood by it, taught it to men who professed to
believe in the Westminster Confession.&nbsp; The preacher who
preaches it uses a vocabulary which has a certain definite
meaning, and has had this meaning for centuries.&nbsp; He cannot
stay to put his own interpretation upon it whenever it is upon
his lips, and so his hearers are in a false position, and imagine
him to be much more orthodox than he really is.</p>
<p>For some time I fell into this snare, until one day I happened
to be reading the story of Balaam.&nbsp; Balaam, though most
desirous to prophesy smooth things for Balak, had nevertheless a
word put into his mouth by God.&nbsp; When he came to Balak he
was unable to curse, and could do nothing but bless.&nbsp; Balak,
much dissatisfied, thought that a change of position might alter
Balaam&rsquo;s temper, and he brought him away from the high
places of Baal to the field of Zophim, to the top of
Pisgah.&nbsp; But Balaam could do nothing better even on
Pisgah.&nbsp; Not even a compromise was possible, and the second
blessing was more emphatic than the first.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God,&rdquo; cried the prophet, pressed sorely by his
message, &ldquo;is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son
of man, that He should repent: hath He said, and shall He not do
it? or hath He spoken, and shall He not make it good?&nbsp;
Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and He hath
blessed; and I cannot reverse it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was very unsatisfactory, and Balaam was asked, if he
could not curse, at least to refrain from benediction.&nbsp; The
answer was still the same.&nbsp; &ldquo;Told not I thee, saying,
All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do?&rdquo;&nbsp; A third
shift was tried, and Balaam went to the top of Peor.&nbsp; This
was worse than ever.&nbsp; The Spirit of the Lord came upon him,
and he broke out into triumphal anticipation of the future
glories of Israel.&nbsp; Balak remonstrated in wrath, but Balaam
was altogether inaccessible.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Balak would give me
his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the
commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine own
mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story greatly impressed me, and I date from it a distinct
disinclination to tamper with myself, or to deliver what I had to
deliver in phrases which, though they might be conciliatory, were
misleading.</p>
<p>About this time there was a movement in the town to obtain a
better supply of water.&nbsp; The soil was gravelly and full of
cesspools, side by side with which were sunk the wells.&nbsp; A
public meeting was held, and I attended and spoke on behalf of
the scheme.&nbsp; There was much opposition, mainly on the score
that the rates would be increased, and on the Saturday after the
meeting the following letter appeared in the <i>Sentinel</i>, the
local paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is
not my desire to enter into the controversy now raging about the
water-supply of this town, but I must say I was much surprised
that a minister of religion should interfere in politics.&nbsp;
Sir, I cannot help thinking that if the said minister would
devote himself to the Water of Life&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;that
gentle fount<br />
Progressing from Immanuel&rsquo;s mount,&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>it would be much more harmonious with his function as a
follower of him who knew nothing save Christ crucified.&nbsp;
Sir, I have no wish to introduce controversial topics upon a
subject like religion into your columns, which are allotted to a
different line, but I must be permitted to observe that I fail to
see how a minister&rsquo;s usefulness can be stimulated if he
sets class against class.&nbsp; Like the widows in affliction of
old, he should keep himself pure and unspotted from the
world.&nbsp; How can many of us accept the glorious gospel on the
Sabbath from a man who will incur spots during the week by
arguing about cesspools like any other man?&nbsp; Sir, I will say
nothing, moreover, about a minister of the gospel assisting to
bind burdens&mdash;that is to say, rates and taxation&mdash;upon
the shoulders of men grievous to be borne.&nbsp; Surely, sir, a
minister of the Lamb of God, who was shed for the remission of
sins, should be <i>against</i> burdens.&mdash;I am sir, your
obedient servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;A <span
class="smcap">Christian Tradesman</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had not the least doubt as to the authorship of this
precious epistle.&nbsp; Mr. Snale&rsquo;s hand was apparent in
every word.&nbsp; He was fond of making religious verses, and
once we were compelled to hear the Sunday-school children sing a
hymn which he had composed.&nbsp; The two lines of poetry were
undoubtedly his.&nbsp; Furthermore, although he had been a
chapel-goer all his life, he muddled, invariably, passages from
the Bible.&nbsp; They had no definite meaning for him, and there
was nothing, consequently, to prevent his tacking the end of one
verse to the beginning of another.&nbsp; Mr. Snale, too,
continually &ldquo;failed to see.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where he got the
phrase I do not know, but he liked it, and was always repeating
it.&nbsp; However, I had no external evidence that it was he who
was my enemy, and I held my peace.&nbsp; I was supported at the
public meeting by a speaker from the body of the hall whom I had
never seen before.&nbsp; He spoke remarkably well, was evidently
educated, and I was rather curious about him.</p>
<p>It was my custom on Saturdays to go out for the whole of the
day by the river, seawards, to prepare for the Sunday.&nbsp; I
was coming home rather tired, when I met this same man against a
stile.&nbsp; He bade me good-evening, and then proceeded to thank
me for my speech, saying many complimentary things about
it.&nbsp; I asked who it was to whom I had the honour of talking,
and he told me he was Edward Gibbon Mardon.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
Edward Gibson Mardon once, sir,&rdquo; he said, smilingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gibson was the name of a rich old aunt who was expected to
do something for me, but I disliked her, and never went near
her.&nbsp; I did not see why I should be ticketed with her label,
and as Edward Gibson was very much like Edward Gibbon, the
immortal author of the <i>Decline and Fall</i>, I dropped the
&lsquo;s&rsquo; and stuck in a &lsquo;b.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am
nothing but a compositor on the <i>Sentinel</i>, and Saturday
afternoon, after the paper is out, is a holiday for me, unless
there is any reporting to do, for I have to turn my attention to
that occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Edward Gibbon Mardon, I observed, was slightly built,
rather short, and had scanty whiskers which developed into a
little thicker tuft on his chin.&nbsp; His eyes were pure blue,
like the blue of the speedwell.&nbsp; They were not piercing, but
perfectly transparent, indicative of a character which, if it
possessed no particular creative power, would not permit
self-deception.&nbsp; They were not the eyes of a prophet, but of
a man who would not be satisfied with letting a half-known thing
alone and saying he believed it.&nbsp; His lips were thin, but
not compressed into bitterness; and above everything there was in
his face a perfectly legible frankness, contrasting pleasantly
with the doubtfulness of most of the faces I knew.&nbsp; I
expressed my gratitude to him for his kind opinion, and as we
loitered he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to see that attack upon you in the
<i>Sentinel</i>.&nbsp; I suppose you are aware it was
Snale&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Everybody could tell that who knows the
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is Mr. Snale&rsquo;s, I am very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Snale&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He is a contemptible cur and
yet it is not his fault.&nbsp; He has heard sermons about all
sorts of supernatural subjects for thirty years, and he has never
once been warned against meanness, so of course he supposes that
supernatural subjects are everything and meanness is
nothing.&nbsp; But I will not detain you any longer now, for you
are busy.&nbsp; Good-night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather abrupt and disappointing.&nbsp; However, I was
much absorbed in the morrow, and passed on.</p>
<p>Although I despised Snale, his letter was the beginning of a
great trouble to me.&nbsp; I had now been preaching for many
months, and had met with no response whatever.&nbsp; Occasionally
a stranger or two visited the chapel, and with what eager eyes
did I not watch for them on the next Sunday, but none of them
came twice.&nbsp; It was amazing to me that I could pour out
myself as I did&mdash;poor although I knew that self to
be&mdash;and yet make so little impression.&nbsp; Not one man or
woman seemed any different because of anything I had said or
done, and not a soul kindled at any word of mine, no matter with
what earnestness it might be charged.&nbsp; How I groaned over my
incapacity to stir in my people any participation in my thoughts
or care for them!</p>
<p>Looking at the history of those days now from a distance of
years, everything assumes its proper proportion.&nbsp; I was at
work, it is true, amongst those who were exceptionally hard and
worldly, but I was seeking amongst men (to put it in orthodox
language) what I ought to have sought with God alone.&nbsp; In
other, and perhaps plainer phrase, I was expecting from men a
sympathy which proceeds from the Invisible only.&nbsp; Sometimes,
indeed, it manifests itself in the long-postponed justice of
time, but more frequently it is nothing more and nothing less
than a consciousness of approval by the Unseen, a peace
unspeakable, which is bestowed on us when self is suppressed.</p>
<p>I did not know then how little one man can change another, and
what immense and persistent efforts are necessary&mdash;efforts
which seldom succeed except in childhood&mdash;to accomplish
anything but the most superficial alteration of character.&nbsp;
Stories are told of sudden conversions, and of course if a poor
simple creature can be brought to believe that hell-fire awaits
him as the certain penalty of his misdeeds, he will cease to do
them; but this is no real conversion, for essentially he remains
pretty much the same kind of being that he was before.</p>
<p>I remember while this mood was on me, that I was much struck
with the absolute loneliness of Jesus, and with His horror of
that death upon the cross.&nbsp; He was young and full of
enthusiastic hope, but when He died He had found hardly anything
but misunderstanding.&nbsp; He had written nothing, so that He
could not expect that His life would live after Him.&nbsp;
Nevertheless His confidence in His own errand had risen so high,
that He had not hesitated to proclaim Himself the Messiah: not
the Messiah the Jews were expecting, but still the Messiah.&nbsp;
I dreamed over His walks by the lake, over the deeper solitude of
His last visit to Jerusalem, and over the gloom of that awful
Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The hold which He has upon us is easily explained, apart from
the dignity of His recorded sayings and the purity of His
life.&nbsp; There is no Saviour for us like the hero who has
passed triumphantly through the distress which troubles
<i>us</i>.&nbsp; Salvation is the spectacle of a victory by
another over foes like our own.&nbsp; The story of Jesus is the
story of the poor and forgotten.&nbsp; He is not the Saviour for
the rich and prosperous, for they want no Saviour.&nbsp; The
healthy, active, and well-to-do need Him not, and require nothing
more than is given by their own health and prosperity.&nbsp; But
every one who has walked in sadness because his destiny has not
fitted his aspirations; every one who, having no opportunity to
lift himself out of his little narrow town or village circle of
acquaintances, has thirsted for something beyond what they could
give him; everybody who, with nothing but a dull, daily round of
mechanical routine before him, would welcome death, if it were
martyrdom for a cause; every humblest creature, in the obscurity
of great cities or remote hamlets, who silently does his or her
duty without recognition&mdash;all these turn to Jesus, and find
themselves in Him.&nbsp; He died, faithful to the end, with
infinitely higher hopes, purposes, and capacity than mine, and
with almost no promise of anything to come of them.</p>
<p>Something of this kind I preached one Sunday, more as a relief
to myself than for any other reason.&nbsp; Mardon was there, and
with him a girl whom I had not seen before.&nbsp; My sight is
rather short, and I could not very well tell what she was
like.&nbsp; After the service was over he waited for me, and said
he had done so to ask me if I would pay him a visit on Monday
evening.&nbsp; I promised to do so, and accordingly went.</p>
<p>I found him living in a small brick-built cottage near the
outskirts of the town, the rental of which I should suppose would
be about seven or eight pounds a year.&nbsp; There was a patch of
ground in front and a little garden behind&mdash;a kind of narrow
strip about fifty feet long, separated from the other little
strips by iron hurdles.&nbsp; Mardon had tried to keep his garden
in order, and had succeeded, but his neighbour was disorderly,
and had allowed weeds to grow, blacking bottles and old tin cans
to accumulate, so that whatever pleasure Mardon&rsquo;s labours
might have afforded was somewhat spoiled.</p>
<p>He himself came to the door when I knocked, and I was shown
into a kind of sitting-room with a round table in the middle and
furnished with Windsor chairs, two arm-chairs of the same kind
standing on either side the fireplace.&nbsp; Against the window
was a smaller table with a green baize tablecloth, and about
half-a-dozen plants stood on the window-sill, serving as a
screen.&nbsp; In the recess on one side of the fireplace was a
cupboard, upon the top of which stood a tea-caddy, a workbox,
some tumblers, and a decanter full of water; the other side being
filled with a bookcase and books.&nbsp; There were two or three
pictures on the walls; one was a portrait of Voltaire, another of
Lord Bacon, and a third was Albert D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s St.
Jerome.&nbsp; This latter was an heirloom, and greatly prized I
could perceive, as it was hung in the place of honour over the
mantelpiece.</p>
<p>After some little introductory talk, the same girl whom I had
noticed with Mardon at the chapel came in, and I was introduced
to her as his only daughter Mary.&nbsp; She began to busy herself
at once in getting the tea.&nbsp; She was under the average
height for a woman, and delicately built.&nbsp; Her head was
small, but the neck was long.&nbsp; Her hair was brown, of a
peculiarly lustrous tint, partly due to nature, but also to a
looseness of arrangement and a most diligent use of the brush, so
that the light fell not upon a dead compact mass, but upon
myriads of individual hairs, each of which reflected the
light.&nbsp; Her eyes, so far as I could make out, were a kind of
greenish grey, but the eyelashes were long, so that it was
difficult exactly to discover what was underneath them.&nbsp; The
hands were small, and the whole figure exquisitely graceful; the
plain black dress, which she wore fastened right up to the
throat, suiting her to perfection.&nbsp; Her face, as I first
thought, did not seem indicative of strength.&nbsp; The lips were
thin, but not straight, the upper lip showing a remarkable curve
in it.&nbsp; Nor was it a handsome face.&nbsp; The complexion was
not sufficiently transparent, nor were the features regular.</p>
<p>During tea she spoke very little, but I noticed one
peculiarity about her manner of talking, and that was its perfect
simplicity.&nbsp; There was no sort of effort or strain in
anything she said, no attempt by emphasis of words to make up for
the weakness of thought, and no compliance with that vulgar and
most disagreeable habit of using intense language to describe
what is not intense in itself.&nbsp; Her yea was yea, and her no,
no.&nbsp; I observed also that she spoke without disguise,
although she was not rude.&nbsp; The manners of the cultivated
classes are sometimes very charming, and more particularly their
courtesy, which puts the guest so much at his ease, and
constrains him to believe that an almost personal interest is
taken in his affairs, but after a time it becomes
wearisome.&nbsp; It is felt to be nothing but courtesy, the
result of a rule of conduct uniform for all, and verging very
closely upon hypocrisy.&nbsp; We long rather for plainness of
speech, for some intimation of the person with whom we are
talking, and that the mask and gloves may be laid aside.</p>
<p>Tea being over, Miss Mardon cleared away the tea-things, and
presently came back again.&nbsp; She took one of the arm-chairs
by the side of the fireplace, which her father had reserved for
her, and while he and I were talking, she sat with her head
leaning a little sideways on the back of the chair.&nbsp; I could
just discern that her feet, which rested on the stool, were very
diminutive, like her hands.</p>
<p>The talk with Mardon turned upon the chapel.&nbsp; I had begun
it by saying that I had noticed him there on the Sunday just
mentioned.&nbsp; He then explained why he never went to any place
of worship.&nbsp; A purely orthodox preacher it was, of course,
impossible for him to hear, but he doubted also the efficacy of
preaching.&nbsp; What could be the use of it, supposing the
preacher no longer to be a believer in the common creeds?&nbsp;
If he turns himself into a mere lecturer on all sorts of topics,
he does nothing more than books do, and they do it much
better.&nbsp; He must base himself upon the Bible, and above all
upon Christ, and how can he base himself upon a myth?&nbsp; We do
not know that Christ ever lived, or that if He lived His life was
anything like what is attributed to Him.&nbsp; A mere
juxtaposition of the Gospels shows how the accounts of His words
and deeds differ according to the tradition followed by each of
His biographers.</p>
<p>I interrupted Mardon at this point by saying that it did not
matter whether Christ actually existed or not.&nbsp; What the
four evangelists recorded was eternally true, and the Christ-idea
was true whether it was ever incarnated or not in a being bearing
His name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Mardon, &ldquo;but it does very
much matter.&nbsp; It is all the matter whether we are dealing
with a dream or with reality.&nbsp; I can dream about a
man&rsquo;s dying on the cross in homage to what he believed, but
I would not perhaps die there myself; and when I suffer from
hesitation whether I ought to sacrifice myself for the truth, it
is of immense assistance to me to know that a greater sacrifice
has been made before me&mdash;that a greater sacrifice is
possible.&nbsp; To know that somebody has poetically imagined
that it is possible, and has very likely been altogether
incapable of its achievement, is no help.&nbsp; Moreover, the
commonplaces which even the most freethinking of Unitarians seem
to consider as axiomatic, are to me far from certain, and even
unthinkable.&nbsp; For example, they are always talking about the
omnipotence of God.&nbsp; But power even of the supremest kind
necessarily implies an object&mdash;that is to say,
resistance.&nbsp; Without an object which resists it, it would be
a blank, and what, then, is the meaning of omnipotence?&nbsp; It
is not that it is merely inconceivable; it is nonsense, and so
are all these abstract, illimitable, self-annihilative attributes
of which God is made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This negative criticism, in which Mardon greatly excelled, was
all new to me, and I had no reply to make.&nbsp; He had a
sledge-hammer way of expressing himself, while I, on the
contrary, always required time to bring into shape what I
saw.&nbsp; Just then I saw nothing; I was stunned, bewildered,
out of the sphere of my own thoughts, and pained at the roughness
with which he treated what I had cherished.</p>
<p>I was presently relieved, however, of further reflection by
Mardon&rsquo;s asking his daughter whether her face was
better.&nbsp; It turned out that all the afternoon and evening
she had suffered greatly from neuralgia.&nbsp; She had said
nothing about it while I was there, but had behaved with
cheerfulness and freedom.&nbsp; Mentally I had accused her of
slightness, and inability to talk upon the subjects which
interested Mardon and myself; but when I knew she had been in
torture all the time, my opinion was altered.&nbsp; I thought how
rash I had been in judging her as I continually judged other
people, without being aware of everything they had to pass
through; and I thought, too, that if I had a fit of neuralgia,
everybody near me would know it, and be almost as much annoyed by
me as I myself should be by the pain.</p>
<p>It is curious, also, that when thus proclaiming my troubles I
often considered. my eloquence meritorious, or, at least, a kind
of talent for which I ought to praise God, contemning rather my
silent friends as something nearer than myself to the
expressionless animals.&nbsp; To parade my toothache, describing
it with unusual adjectives, making it felt by all the company in
which I might happen to be, was to me an assertion of my superior
nature.&nbsp; But, looking at Mary, and thinking about her as I
walked home, I perceived that her ability to be quiet, to subdue
herself, to resist the temptation for a whole evening of drawing
attention to herself by telling us what she was enduring, was
heroism, and that my contrary tendency was pitiful vanity.&nbsp;
I perceived that such virtues as patience and
self-denial&mdash;which, clad in russet dress, I had often passed
by unnoticed when I had found them amongst the poor or the
humble&mdash;were more precious and more ennobling to their
possessor than poetic yearnings, or the power to propound
rhetorically to the world my grievances or agonies.</p>
<p>Miss Mardon&rsquo;s face was getting worse, and as by this
time it was late, I stayed but a little while longer.</p>
<h2><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MISS ARBOUR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some months I continued without
much change in my monotonous existence.&nbsp; I did not see
Mardon often, for I rather dreaded him.&nbsp; I could not resist
him, and I shrank from what I saw to be inevitably true when I
talked to him.&nbsp; I can hardly say it was cowardice.&nbsp;
Those may call it cowardice to whom all associations are nothing,
and to whom beliefs are no more than matters of indifferent
research; but as for me, Mardon&rsquo;s talk darkened my days and
nights.&nbsp; I never could understand the light manner in which
people will discuss the gravest questions, such as God and the
immortality of the soul.&nbsp; They gossip about them over their
tea, write and read review articles about them, and seem to
consider affirmation or negation of no more practical importance
than the conformation of a beetle.&nbsp; With me the struggle to
retain as much as I could of my creed was tremendous.&nbsp; The
dissolution of Jesus into mythologic vapour was nothing less than
the death of a friend dearer to me then than any other friend
whom I knew.</p>
<p>But the worst stroke of all was that which fell upon the
doctrine of a life beyond the grave.&nbsp; In theory I had long
despised the notion that we should govern our conduct here by
hope of reward or fear of punishment hereafter.&nbsp; But under
Mardon&rsquo;s remorseless criticism, when he insisted on asking
for the where and how, and pointed out that all attempts to say
where and how ended in nonsense, my hope began to fail, and I was
surprised to find myself incapable of living with proper serenity
if there was nothing but blank darkness before me at the end of a
few years.</p>
<p>As I got older I became aware of the folly of this perpetual
reaching after the future, and of drawing from to-morrow, and
from to-morrow only, a reason for the joyfulness of to-day.&nbsp;
I learned, when, alas! it was almost too late, to live in each
moment as it passed over my head, believing that the sun as it is
now rising is as good as it will ever be, and blinding myself as
much as possible to what may follow.&nbsp; But when I was young I
was the victim of that illusion, implanted for some purpose or
other in us by Nature, which causes us, on the brightest morning
in June, to think immediately of a brighter morning which is to
come in July.&nbsp; I say nothing, now, for or against the
doctrine of immortality.&nbsp; All I say is, that men have been
happy without it, even under the pressure of disaster, and that
to make immortality a sole spring of action here is an
exaggeration of the folly which deludes us all through life with
endless expectation, and leaves us at death without the thorough
enjoyment of a single hour.</p>
<p>So I shrank from Mardon, but none the less did the process of
excavation go on.&nbsp; It often happens that a man loses faith
without knowing it.&nbsp; Silently the foundation is sapped while
the building stands fronting the sun, as solid to all appearance
as when it was first turned out of the builder&rsquo;s hands, but
at last it falls suddenly with a crash.&nbsp; It was so at this
time with a personal relationship of mine, about which I have
hitherto said nothing.</p>
<p>Years ago, before I went to college, and when I was a teacher
in the Sunday-school, I had fallen in love with one of my
fellow-teachers, and we became engaged.&nbsp; She was the
daughter of one of the deacons.&nbsp; She had a smiling, pretty,
vivacious face; was always somehow foremost in school treats,
picnics, and chapel-work, and she had a kind of piquant manner,
which to many men is more ensnaring than beauty.&nbsp; She never
read anything; she was too restless and fond of outward activity
for that, and no questions about orthodoxy or heresy ever
troubled her head.&nbsp; We continued our correspondence
regularly after my appointment as minister, and her friends, I
knew, were looking to me to fix a day for marriage.&nbsp; But
although we had been writing to one another as affectionately as
usual, a revolution had taken place.&nbsp; I was quite
unconscious of it, for we had been betrothed for so long that I
never once considered the possibility of any rupture.</p>
<p>One Monday morning, however, I had a letter from her.&nbsp; It
was not often that she wrote on Sunday, as she had a religious
prejudice against writing letters on that day.&nbsp; However,
this was urgent, for it was to tell me that an aunt of hers who
was staying at her father&rsquo;s was just dead, and that her
uncle wanted her to go and live with him for some time, to look
after the little children who were left behind.&nbsp; She said
that her dear aunt died a beautiful death, trusting in the merits
of the Redeemer.&nbsp; She also added, in a very delicate way,
that she would have agreed to go to her uncle&rsquo;s at once,
but she had understood that we were to be married soon, and she
did not like to leave home for long.&nbsp; She was evidently
anxious for me to tell her what to do.</p>
<p>This letter, as I have said, came to me on Monday, when I was
exhausted by a more than usually desolate Sunday.&nbsp; I became
at once aware that my affection for her, if it ever really
existed, had departed.&nbsp; I saw before me the long days of
wedded life with no sympathy, and I shuddered when I thought what
I should do with such a wife.&nbsp; How could I take her to
Mardon?&nbsp; How could I ask him to come to me?&nbsp; Strange to
say, my pride suffered most.&nbsp; I could have endured, I
believe, even discord at home, if only I could have had a woman
whom I could present to my friends, and whom they would
admire.&nbsp; I was never unselfish in the way in which women
are, and yet I have always been more anxious that people should
respect my wife than respect me, and at any time would withdraw
myself into the shade if only she might be brought into the
light.&nbsp; This is nothing noble.&nbsp; It is an obscure form
of egotism probably, but anyhow, such always was my case.</p>
<p>It took but a very few hours to excite me to
distraction.&nbsp; I had gone on for years without realising what
I saw now, and although in the situation itself the change had
been only gradual, it instantaneously became intolerable.&nbsp;
Yet I never was more incapable of acting.&nbsp; What could I
do?&nbsp; After such a long betrothal, to break loose from her
would be cruel and shameful.&nbsp; I could never hold up my head
again, and in the narrow circle of Independency, the whole affair
would be known and my prospects ruined.</p>
<p>Then other and subtler reasons presented themselves.&nbsp; No
men can expect ideal attachments.&nbsp; We must be satisfied with
ordinary humanity.&nbsp; Doubtless my friend with a lofty
imagination would be better matched with some Antigone who exists
somewhere and whom he does not know.&nbsp; But he wisely does not
spend his life in vain search after her, but settles down with
the first decently sensible woman he finds in his own street, and
makes the best of his bargain.&nbsp; Besides, there was the power
of use and wont to be considered.&nbsp; Ellen had no vice of
temper, no meanness, and it was not improbable that she would be
just as good a helpmeet for me in time as I had a right to
ask.&nbsp; Living together, we should mould one another, and at
last like one another.&nbsp; Marrying her, I should be relieved
from the insufferable solitude which was depressing me to death,
and should have a home.</p>
<p>So it has always been with me.&nbsp; When there has been the
sternest need of promptitude, I have seen such multitudes of
arguments for and against every course that I have
despaired.&nbsp; I have at my command any number of maxims, all
of them good, but I am powerless to select the one which ought to
be applied.</p>
<p>A general principle, a fine saying, is nothing but a tool, and
the wit of man is shown not in possession of a well-furnished
tool-chest, but in the ability to pick out the proper instrument
and use it.</p>
<p>I remained in this miserable condition for days, not venturing
to answer Ellen&rsquo;s letter, until at last I turned out for a
walk.&nbsp; I have often found that motion and change will bring
light and resolution when thinking will not.&nbsp; I started off
in the morning down by the river, and towards the sea, my
favourite stroll.&nbsp; I went on and on under a leaden sky,
through the level, solitary, marshy meadows, where the river
began to lose itself in the ocean, and I wandered about there,
struggling for guidance.&nbsp; In my distress I actually knelt
down and prayed, but the heavens remained impassive as before,
and I was half ashamed of what I had done, as if it were a piece
of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>At last, wearied out, I turned homeward, and diverging from
the direct road, I was led past the house where the Misses Arbour
lived.&nbsp; I was faint, and some beneficent inspiration
prompted me to call.&nbsp; I went in, and found that the younger
of the two sisters was out.&nbsp; A sudden tendency to hysterics
overcame me, and I asked for a glass of water.&nbsp; Miss Arbour,
having given it to me, sat down by the side of the fireplace
opposite to the one at which I was sitting, and for a few moments
there was silence.&nbsp; I made some commonplace observation, but
instead of answering me she said quietly, &ldquo;Mr. Rutherford,
you have been upset; I hope you have met with no
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How it came about I do not know, but my whole story rushed to
my lips, and I told her all of it with quivering voice.&nbsp; I
cannot imagine what possessed me to make her my confidante.&nbsp;
Shy, reserved, and proud, I would have died rather than have
breathed a syllable of my secret if I had been in my ordinary
humour, but her soft, sweet face altogether overpowered me.</p>
<p>As I proceeded with my tale, the change that came over her was
most remarkable.&nbsp; When I began she was leaning back placidly
in her large chair, with her handkerchief upon her lap; but
gradually her face kindled, she sat upright, and she was
transformed with a completeness and suddenness which I could not
have conceived possible.&nbsp; At last, when I had finished, she
put both her hands to her forehead, and almost shrieked out,
&ldquo;Shall I tell him?&mdash;O my God, shall I tell
him?&mdash;may God have mercy on him!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was amazed
beyond measure at the altogether unsuspected depth of passion
which was revealed in her whom I had never before seen disturbed
by more than a ripple of emotion.&nbsp; She drew her chair nearer
to mine, put both her hands on my knees, looked right into my
eyes, and said, &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then moved back a
little, and spoke as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is forty-five years ago this month since I was
married.&nbsp; You are surprised; you have always known me under
my maiden name, and you thought I had always been single.&nbsp;
It is forty-six years ago this month since the man who afterwards
became my husband first saw me.&nbsp; He was a partner in a cloth
firm.&nbsp; At that time it was the duty of one member of a firm
to travel, and he came to our town, where my father was a
well-to-do carriage-builder.&nbsp; My father was an old customer
of his house, and the relationship between the customer and the
wholesale merchant was then very different from what it is
now.&nbsp; Consequently, Mr. Hexton&mdash;for that was my
husband&rsquo;s name&mdash;was continually asked to stay with us
so long as he remained in the town.&nbsp; He was what might be
called a singularly handsome man&mdash;that is to say, he was
upright, well-made, with a straight nose, black hair, dark eyes,
and a good complexion.&nbsp; He dressed with perfect neatness and
good taste, and had the reputation of being a most temperate and
most moral man, much respected&mdash;amongst the sect to which
both of us belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he first came our way I was about nineteen and he
about three-and-twenty.&nbsp; My father and his had long been
acquainted, and he was of course received even with
cordiality.&nbsp; I was excitable, a lover of poetry, a reader of
all sorts of books, and much given to enthusiasm.&nbsp; Ah! you
do not think so, you do not see how that can have been, but you
do not know how unaccountable is the development of the soul, and
what is the meaning of any given form of character which presents
itself to you.&nbsp; You see nothing but the peaceful, long since
settled result, but how it came there, what its history has been,
you cannot tell.&nbsp; It may always have been there, or have
gradually grown so, in gradual progress from seed to flower, or
it may be the final repose of tremendous forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will show you what I was like at nineteen,&rdquo; and
she got up and turned to a desk, from which she took a little
ivory miniature.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was
given to Mr. Hexton when we were engaged.&nbsp; I thought he
would have locked it up, but he used to leave it about, and one
day I found it in the dressing-table drawer, with some brushes
and combs, and two or three letters of mine.&nbsp; I withdrew it,
and burnt the letters.&nbsp; He never asked for it, and here it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head was small and set upon the neck like a flower, but
not bending pensively.&nbsp; It was rather thrown back with a
kind of firmness, and with a peculiarly open air, as if it had
nothing to conceal and wished the world to conceal nothing.&nbsp;
The body was shown down to the waist, and was slim and
graceful.&nbsp; But what was most noteworthy about the picture
was its solemn seriousness, a seriousness capable of infinite
affection, and of infinite abandonment, not sensuous
abandonment&mdash;everything was too severe, too much controlled
by the arch of the top of the head for that&mdash;but of an
abandonment to spiritual aims.</p>
<p>Miss Arbour continued: &ldquo;Mr. Hexton after a while gave me
to understand that he was my admirer, and before six months of
acquaintanceship had passed my mother told me that he had
requested formally that he might be considered as my
suitor.&nbsp; She put no pressure upon me, nor did my father,
excepting that they said that if I would accept Mr. Hexton they
would be content, as they knew him to be a very well-conducted
young man, a member of the church, and prosperous in his
business.&nbsp; My first, and for a time my sovereign, impulse
was to reject him, because I thought him mean, and because I felt
he lacked sympathy with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappily I did not trust that impulse.&nbsp; I looked
for something more authoritative, but I was mistaken, for the
voice of God, to me at least, hardly ever comes in thunder, but I
have to listen with perfect stillness to make it out.&nbsp; It
spoke to me, told me what to do, but I argued with it and was
lost.&nbsp; I was guiltless of any base motive, but I found the
wrong name for what displeased me in Mr. Hexton, and so I deluded
myself.&nbsp; I reasoned that his meanness was justifiable
economy, and that his dissimilarity from me was perhaps the very
thing which ought to induce me to marry him, because he would
correct my failings.&nbsp; I knew I was too inconsiderate, too
rash, too flighty, and I said to myself that his soberness would
be a good thing for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I had but the power to write a book which should
go to the ends of the world, and warn young men and women not to
be led away by any sophistry when choosing their partners for
life!&nbsp; It may be asked, How are we to distinguish heavenly
instigation from hellish temptation?&nbsp; I say, that neither
you nor I, sitting here, can tell how to do it.&nbsp; We can lay
down no law by which infallibly to recognise the messenger from
God.&nbsp; But what I do say is, that when the moment comes, it
is perfectly easy for us to recognise him.&nbsp; Whether we
listen to his message or not is another matter.&nbsp; If we do
not&mdash;if we stop to dispute with him, we are undone, for we
shall very soon learn to discredit him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was married, and I went to live in a dark
manufacturing town, away from all my friends.&nbsp; I awoke to my
misery by degrees, but still rapidly.&nbsp; I had my books sent
down to me.&nbsp; I unpacked them in Mr. Hexton&rsquo;s presence,
and I kindled at the thought of ranging my old favourites in my
sitting-room.&nbsp; He saw my delight as I put them on some empty
shelves, but the next day he said that he wanted a stuffed dog
there, and that he thought my books, especially as they were
shabby, had better go upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to give some entertainments soon
afterwards.&nbsp; The minister and his wife, with some other
friends, came to tea, and the conversation turned on parties and
the dullness of winter evenings if no amusements were
provided.&nbsp; I maintained that rational human beings ought not
to be dependent upon childish games, but ought to be able to
occupy themselves and interest themselves with talk.&nbsp; Talk,
I said&mdash;not gossip, but talk&mdash;pleases me better than
chess or forfeits; and the lines of Cowper occurred to
me&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When one, that holds communion with the
skies,<br />
Has filled his urn where these pure waters rise,<br />
And once more mingles with us meaner things,<br />
&rsquo;Tis even as if an angel shook his wings;<br />
Immortal fragrance fills the circuit wide,<br />
That tells us whence his treasures are supplied.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ventured to repeat this verse, and when I had finished,
there was a pause for a moment, which was broken by my
husband&rsquo;s saying to the minister&rsquo;s wife who sat next
to him, &lsquo;Oh, Mrs. Cook, I quite forgot to express my
sympathy with you; I heard that you had lost your
cat.&rsquo;&nbsp; The blow was deliberately administered, and I
felt it as an insult.&nbsp; I was wrong, I know.&nbsp; I was
ignorant of the ways of the world, and I ought to have been aware
of the folly of placing myself above the level of my guests, and
of the extreme unwisdom of revealing myself in that unguarded way
to strangers.&nbsp; Two or three more experiences of that kind
taught me to close myself carefully to all the world, and to
beware how I uttered anything more than commonplace.&nbsp; But I
was young, and ought to have been pardoned.&nbsp; I felt the
sting of self-humiliation far into the night, as I lay and
silently cried, while Mr. Hexton slept beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I soon found that he was entirely insensible to
everything for which I most cared.&nbsp; Before our marriage he
had affected a sort of interest in my pursuits, but in reality he
was indifferent to them.&nbsp; He was cold, hard, and
impenetrable.&nbsp; His habits were precise and methodical,
beyond what is natural for a man of his years.&nbsp; I remember
one evening&mdash;strange that these small events should so burn
themselves into me&mdash;that some friends were at our house at
tea.&nbsp; A tradesman in the town was mentioned, a member of our
congregation, who had become bankrupt, and everybody began to
abuse him.&nbsp; It was said that he had been extravagant; that
he had chosen to send his children to the grammar-school, where
the children of gentlefolk went; and finally, that only last year
he had let his wife go to the seaside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew what the real state of affairs was.&nbsp; He had
perhaps been living a little beyond his means, but as to the
school, he had rather refined tastes, and he longed to teach his
children something more than the ciphering, as it was called, and
bookkeeping which they would have learned at the academy at which
men in his position usually educated their boys; and as to the
seaside, his wife was ill, and he could not bear to see her
suffering in the smoky street, when he knew that a little fresh
air and change of scene would restore her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I said that I was sorry to hear the poor man
attacked; that he had done wrong, no doubt, but so had the woman
who was brought before Jesus; and that with me, charity or a
large heart covered a multitude of sins.&nbsp; I added that there
was something dreadful in the way in which everybody always
seemed to agree in deserting the unfortunate.&nbsp; I was a
little moved, and unluckily upset a teacup.&nbsp; No harm was
done; and if my husband, who sat next to me, had chosen to take
no notice, there need have been no disturbance whatever.&nbsp;
But he made a great fuss, crying, &lsquo;Oh, my dear, pray
mind!&nbsp; Ring the bell instantly, or it will all be through
the tablecloth.&rsquo;&nbsp; In getting up hastily to obey him, I
happened to drag the cloth, as it lay on my lap; a plate fell
down and was broken; everything was in confusion; I was ashamed
and degraded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe there was a single point in Mr.
Hexton&rsquo;s character in which he touched the universal; not a
single chink, however narrow, through which his soul looked out
of itself upon the great world around.&nbsp; If he had kept bees,
or collected butterflies or beetles, I could have found some
avenue of approach.&mdash;But he had no taste for anything of the
kind.&nbsp; He had his breakfast at eight regularly every
morning, and read his letters at breakfast.&nbsp; He came home to
dinner at two, looked at the newspaper for a little while after
dinner, and then went to sleep.&nbsp; At six he had his tea, and
in half-an-hour went back to his counting-house, which he did not
leave till eight.&nbsp; Supper at nine, and bed at ten, closed
the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a habit of mine to read a little after supper,
and occasionally I read aloud to him passages which struck me,
but I soon gave it up, for once or twice he said to me,
&lsquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got to the bottom of that page, I think
you had better go to bed,&rsquo; although perhaps the page did
not end a sentence.&nbsp; But why weary you with all this?&nbsp;
I pass over all the rest of the hateful details which made life
insupportable to me.&nbsp; Suffice to say, that one wet Sunday
evening, when we could not go to chapel and were in the
dining-room alone, the climax was reached.&nbsp; My husband had a
religious magazine before him, and I sat still, doing
nothing.&nbsp; At last, after an hour had passed without a word,
I could bear it no longer, and I broke out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;James, I am wretched beyond
description!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slowly shut the magazine, tearing a piece of paper
from a letter and putting it in as a mark, and then
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must know.&nbsp; You must know that ever
since we have been married you have never cared for one single
thing I have done or said; that is to say, you have never cared
for me.&nbsp; It is <i>not</i> being married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an explosive outburst, sudden and almost
incoherent, and I cried as if my heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is the meaning of all this?&nbsp; You must
be unwell.&nbsp; Will you not have a glass of wine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not regain myself for some minutes, during
which he sat perfectly still, without speaking, and without
touching me.&nbsp; His coldness nerved me again, congealing all
my emotion into a set resolve, and I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want no wine.&nbsp; I am not unwell.&nbsp; I
do not wish to have a scene.&nbsp; I will not, by useless words,
embitter myself against you, or you against me.&nbsp; You know
you do not love me.&nbsp; I know I do not love you.&nbsp; It is
all a bitter, cursed mistake, and the sooner we say so and
rectify it the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colour left his face; his lips quivered, and he
looked as if he would have killed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What monstrous thing is this?&nbsp; What do you
mean by your tomfooleries?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Speak!&rsquo; he roared.&nbsp; &lsquo;What am I
to understand by rectifying your mistake?&nbsp; By the living
God, you shall not make me the laughing-stock and gossip of the
town!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll crush you first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was astonished to see such rage develop itself so
suddenly in him, and yet afterwards, when I came to reflect, I
saw there was no reason for surprise.&nbsp; Self, self was his
god, and the thought of the damage which would be done to him and
his reputation was what roused him.&nbsp; I was still silent, and
he went on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose you intend to leave me, and you think
you&rsquo;ll disgrace me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll disgrace
yourself.&nbsp; Everybody knows me here, and knows you&rsquo;ve
had every comfort and everything to make you happy.&nbsp;
Everybody will say what everybody will have the right to say
about you.&nbsp; Out with it and confess the truth, that one of
your snivelling poets has fallen in love with you and you with
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still held my peace, but I rose and went into the
best bedchamber, and sat there in the dark till bedtime.&nbsp; I
heard James come upstairs at ten o&rsquo;clock as usual, go to
his own room, and lock himself in.&nbsp; I never hesitated a
moment.&nbsp; I could not go home to become the centre of all the
chatter of the little provincial town in which I was born.&nbsp;
My old nurse, who took care of me as a child, had got a place in
London as housekeeper in a large shop in the Strand.&nbsp; She
was always very fond of me, and to her instantly I determined to
go.&nbsp; I came down, wrote a brief note to James, stating that
after his base and lying sneer he could not expect to find me in
the morning still with him, and telling him I had left him for
ever.&nbsp; I put on my cloak, took some money which was my own
out of my cashbox, and at half-past twelve heard the mail-coach
approaching.&nbsp; I opened the front door softly&mdash;it shut
with an oiled spring bolt; I went out, stopped the coach, and was
presently rolling over the road to the great city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that night!&nbsp; I was the sole passenger inside,
and for some hours I remained stunned, hardly knowing what had
become of me.&nbsp; Soon the morning began to break, with such
calm and such slow-changing splendour that it drew me out of
myself to look at it, and it seemed to me a prophecy of the
future.&nbsp; No words can tell the bound of my heart at
emancipation.&nbsp; I did not know what was before me, but I knew
from what I had escaped; I did not believe I should be pursued,
and no sailor returning from shipwreck and years of absence ever
entered the port where wife and children were with more rapture
than I felt journeying through the rain into which the clouds of
the sunrise dissolved, as we rode over the dim flats of
Huntingdonshire southwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need for me to weary you any longer, nor to
tell you what happened after I got to London, or how I came
here.&nbsp; I had a little property of my own and no child.&nbsp;
To avoid questions I resumed my maiden name.&nbsp; But one thing
you must know, because it will directly tend to enforce what I am
going to beseech of you.&nbsp; Years afterwards, I might have
married a man who was devoted to me.&nbsp; But I told him I was
married already, and not a word of love must he speak to
me.&nbsp; He went abroad in despair, and I have never seen
anything more of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can guess now what I am going to pray of you to
do.&nbsp; Without hesitation, write to this girl and tell her the
exact truth.&nbsp; Anything, any obloquy, anything friends or
enemies may say of you must be faced even joyfully rather than
what I had to endure.&nbsp; Better die the death of the Saviour
on the cross than live such a life as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Miss Arbour, you are doubtless right, but think
what it means.&nbsp; It means nothing less than infamy.&nbsp; It
will be said, I broke the poor thing&rsquo;s heart, and marred
her prospects for ever.&nbsp; What will become of me, as a
minister, when all this is known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught my hand in hers, and cried with indescribable
feeling&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good sir, you are parleying with the great Enemy of
Souls.&nbsp; Oh! if you did but know, if you <i>could</i> but
know, you would be as decisive in your recoil from him, as you
would from hell suddenly opened at your feet.&nbsp; Never mind
the future.&nbsp; The one thing you have to do is the thing that
lies next to you, divinely ordained for you.&nbsp; What does the
119th Psalm say?&mdash;&lsquo;Thy word is a lamp unto my
feet.&rsquo;&nbsp; We have no light promised us to show us our
road a hundred miles away, but we have a light for the next
footstep, and if we take that, we shall have a light for the one
which is to follow.&nbsp; The inspiration of the Almighty could
not make clearer to me the message I deliver to you.&nbsp;
Forgive me&mdash;you are a minister, I know, and perhaps I ought
not to speak so to you, but I am an old woman.&nbsp; Never would
you have heard my history from me, if I had not thought it would
help to save you from something worse than death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment there came a knock at the door, and Miss
Arbour&rsquo;s sister came in.&nbsp; After a few words of
greeting I took my leave and walked home.&nbsp; I was
confounded.&nbsp; Who could have dreamed that such tragic depths
lay behind that serene face, and that her orderly precision was
like the grass and flowers upon volcanic soil with Vesuvian fires
slumbering below?&nbsp; I had been altogether at fault, and I was
taught, what I have since been taught, over and over again, that
unknown abysses, into which the sun never shines, lie covered
with commonplace in men and women, and are revealed only by the
rarest opportunity.</p>
<p>But my thoughts turned almost immediately to myself, and I
could bring myself to no resolve.&nbsp; I was weak and tired, and
the more I thought the less capable was I of coming to any
decision.&nbsp; In the morning, after a restless night, I was in
still greater straits, and being perfectly unable to do anything,
I fled to my usual refuge, the sea.&nbsp; The whole day I swayed
to and fro, without the smallest power to arbitrate between the
contradictory impulses which drew me in opposite directions.</p>
<p>I knew what I ought to do, but Ellen&rsquo;s image was ever
before me, mutely appealing against her wrongs, and I pictured
her deserted and with her life spoiled.&nbsp; I said to myself
that instinct is all very well, but for what purpose is reason
given to us if not to reason with it; and reasoning in the main
is a correction of what is called instinct, and of hasty first
impressions.&nbsp; I knew many cases in which men and women loved
one another without similarity of opinions, and, after all,
similarity of opinions upon theological criticism is a poor bond
of union.&nbsp; But then, no sooner was this pleaded than the
other side of the question was propounded with all its
distinctness, as Miss Arbour had presented it.</p>
<p>I came home thoroughly beaten with fatigue, and went to
bed.&nbsp; Fortunately I sank at once to rest, and with the
morning was born the clear discernment that whatever I ought to
do, it was more manly of me to go than to write to Ellen.&nbsp;
Accordingly, I made arrangements for getting somebody to supply
my place in the pulpit for a couple of Sundays, and went
home.</p>
<h2><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ELLEN AND MARY</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">now</span> found myself in the strangest
position.&nbsp; What was I to do?&nbsp; Was I to go to Ellen at
once and say plainly, &ldquo;I have ceased to care for
you&rdquo;?&nbsp; I did what all weak people do.</p>
<p>I wished that destiny would take the matter out of my
hands.&nbsp; I would have given the world if I could have heard
that Ellen was fonder of somebody else than me, although the
moment the thought came to me I saw its baseness.&nbsp; But
destiny was determined to try me to the uttermost, and make the
task as difficult for me as it could be made.</p>
<p>It was Thursday when I arrived, and somehow or other&mdash;how
I do not know&mdash;I found myself on Thursday afternoon at her
house.&nbsp; She was very pleased to see me, for many
reasons.&nbsp; My last letters had been doubtful and the time for
our marriage, as she at least thought, was at hand.&nbsp; I, on
my part, could not but return the usual embrace, but after the
first few words were over there was a silence, and she noticed
that I did not look well.&nbsp; Anxiously she asked me what was
the matter.&nbsp; I said that something had been upon my mind for
a long time, which I thought it my duty to tell her.&nbsp; I then
went on to say that I felt she ought to know what had
happened.&nbsp; When we were first engaged we both professed the
same faith.&nbsp; From that faith I had gradually departed, and
it seemed to me that it would be wicked if she were not made
acquainted before she took a step which was irrevocable.&nbsp;
This was true, but it was not quite all the truth, and with a
woman&rsquo;s keenness she saw at once everything that was in
me.&nbsp; She broke out instantly with a sob&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rough!&rdquo;&mdash;a nickname she had given
me&mdash;&ldquo;I know what it all means&mdash;you want to get
rid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God help me, if I ever endure greater anguish than I did
then.&nbsp; I could not speak, much less could I weep, and I sat
and watched her for some minutes in silence.&nbsp; My first
impulse was to retract, to put my arms round her neck, and swear
that whatever I might be, Deist or Atheist, nothing should
separate me from her.&nbsp; Old associations, the thought of the
cruel injustice put upon her, the display of an emotion which I
had never seen in her before, almost overmastered me, and why I
did not yield I do not know.&nbsp; Again and again have I failed
to make out what it is which, in moments of extreme peril, has
restrained me from making some deadly mistake, when I have not
been aware of the conscious exercise of any authority of my
own.&nbsp; At last I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen, what else was I to do?&nbsp; I cannot help my
conversion to another creed.&nbsp; Supposing you had found out
that you had married a Unitarian and I had never told
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rough! you are not a Unitarian, you don&rsquo;t
love me,&rdquo; and she sobbed afresh.</p>
<p>I could not plead against hysterics.&nbsp; I was afraid she
would get ill.&nbsp; I thought nobody was in the house, and I
rushed across the passage to get her some stimulants.&nbsp; When
I came back her father was in the room.&nbsp; He was my
aversion&mdash;a fussy, conceited man, who always prated about
&ldquo;my daughter&rdquo; to me in a tone which was very
repulsive&mdash;just as if she were his property, and he were her
natural protector against me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rutherford,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what is the
matter with my daughter?&nbsp; What have you said to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, sir, I am bound to tell you.&nbsp;
It is a matter between Ellen and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rutherford, I demand an explanation.&nbsp; Ellen is
mine.&nbsp; I am her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, if I desire not to have a scene here
just now.&nbsp; Ellen is unwell.&nbsp; When she recovers she will
tell you.&nbsp; I had better leave,&rdquo; and I walked straight
out of the house.</p>
<p>Next morning I had a letter from her father to say, that
whether I was a Unitarian or not, my behaviour to Ellen showed I
was bad enough to be one.&nbsp; Anyhow, he had forbidden her all
further intercourse with me.&nbsp; When I had once more settled
down in my solitude, and came to think over what had happened, I
felt the self-condemnation of a criminal without being able to
accuse myself of a crime.&nbsp; I believe with Miss Arbour that
it is madness for a young man who finds out he has made a
blunder, not to set it right; no matter what the wrench may
be.&nbsp; But that Ellen was a victim I do not deny.&nbsp; If any
sin, however, was committed against her, it was committed long
before our separation.&nbsp; It was nine-tenths mistake and
one-tenth something more heinous; and the worst of it is, that
while there is nothing which a man does which is of greater
consequence than the choice of a woman with whom he is to live,
there is nothing he does in which he is more liable to
self-deception.</p>
<p>On my return I heard that Mardon was ill, and that probably he
would die.&nbsp; During my absence a contested election for the
county had taken place, and our town was one of the
polling-places.&nbsp; The lower classes were violently
Tory.&nbsp; During the excitement of the contest the mob had set
upon Mardon as he was going to his work, and had reviled him as a
Republican and an Atheist.&nbsp; By way of proving their theism
they had cursed him with many oaths, and had so sorely beaten him
that the shock was almost fatal.&nbsp; I went to see him
instantly, and found him in much pain, believing that he would
not get better, but perfectly peaceful.</p>
<p>I knew that he had no faith in immortality, and I was curious
beyond measure to see how he would encounter death without such a
faith; for the problem of death, and of life after death, was
still absorbing me even to the point of monomania.&nbsp; I had
been struggling as best I could to protect myself against it, but
with little success.&nbsp; I had long since seen the absurdity
and impossibility of the ordinary theories of hell and
heaven.&nbsp; I could not give up my hope in a continuance of
life beyond the grave, but the moment I came to ask myself how, I
was involved in contradictions.&nbsp; Immortality is not really
immortality of the person unless the memory abides and there be a
connection of the self of the next world with the self here, and
it was incredible to me that there should be any memories or any
such connection after the dissolution of the body; moreover, the
soul, whatever it may be, is so intimately one with the body, and
is affected so seriously by the weaknesses, passions, and
prejudices of the body, that without it my soul would not be
myself, and the fable of the resurrection of the body, of this
same brain and heart, was more than I could ever swallow in my
most orthodox days.</p>
<p>But the greatest difficulty was the inability to believe that
the Almighty intended to preserve all the mass of human beings,
all the countless millions of barbaric, half-bestial forms which,
since the appearance of man, had wandered upon the earth, savage
or civilised.&nbsp; Is it like Nature&rsquo;s way to be so
careful about individuals, and is it to be supposed that, having
produced, millions of years ago, a creature scarcely nobler than
the animals he tore with his fingers, she should take pains to
maintain him in existence for evermore?&nbsp; The law of the
universe everywhere is rather the perpetual rise from the lower
to the higher; an immortality of aspiration after more perfect
types; a suppression and happy forgetfulness of its comparative
failures.</p>
<p>There was nevertheless an obstacle to the acceptance of this
negation in a faintness of heart which I could not
overcome.&nbsp; Why this ceaseless struggle, if in a few short
years I was to be asleep for ever?&nbsp; The position of mortal
man seemed to me infinitely tragic.&nbsp; He is born into the
world, beholds its grandeur and beauty, is filled with
unquenchable longings, and knows that in a few inevitable
revolutions of the earth he will cease.&nbsp; More painful still;
he loves somebody, man or woman, with a surpassing devotion; he
is so lost in his love that he cannot endure a moment without it;
and when he sees it pass away in death, he is told that it is
extinguished&mdash;that that heart and mind absolutely are
<i>not</i>.</p>
<p>It was always a weakness with me that certain thoughts preyed
on me.&nbsp; I was always singularly feeble in laying hold of an
idea, and in the ability to compel myself to dwell upon a thing
for any lengthened period in continuous exhaustive
reflection.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, ideas would frequently lay
hold of me with such relentless tenacity that I was passive in
their grasp.&nbsp; So it was about this time with death and
immortality, and I watched eagerly Mardon&rsquo;s behaviour when
the end had to be faced.&nbsp; As I have said, he was altogether
calm.&nbsp; I did not like to question him while he was so
unwell, because I knew that a discussion would arise which I
could not control, and it might disturb him, but I would have
given anything to understand what was passing in his mind.</p>
<p>During his sickness I was much impressed by Mary&rsquo;s
manner of nursing him.&nbsp; She was always entirely wrapped up
in her father, so much so, that I had often doubted if she could
survive him; but she never revealed any trace of agitation.&nbsp;
Under the pressure of the calamity which had befallen her, she
showed rather increased steadiness, and even a cheerfulness which
surprised me.&nbsp; Nothing went wrong in the house.&nbsp;
Everything was perfectly ordered, perfectly quiet, and she rose
to a height of which I had never suspected her capable, while her
father&rsquo;s stronger nature was allowed to predominate.&nbsp;
She was absolutely dependent on him.&nbsp; If he did not get well
she would be penniless, and I could not help thinking that with
the like chance before me, to say nothing of my love for him and
anxiety lest he should die, I should be distracted, and lose my
head; more especially if I had to sit by his bed, and spend
sleepless nights such as fell to her lot.&nbsp; But she belonged
to that class of natures which, although delicate and fragile,
rejoice in difficulty.&nbsp; Her grief for her father was
exquisite, but it was controlled by a sense of her
responsibility.&nbsp; The greater the peril, the more complete
was her self-command.</p>
<p>To the surprise of everybody Mardon got better.&nbsp; His
temperate habits befriended him in a manner which amazed his more
indulgent neighbours, who were accustomed to hot suppers, and
whisky-and-water after them.&nbsp; Meanwhile I fell into greater
difficulties than ever in my ministry.&nbsp; I wonder now that I
was not stopped earlier.&nbsp; I was entirely unorthodox, through
mere powerlessness to believe, and the catalogue of the articles
of faith to which I might be said really to subscribe was very
brief.&nbsp; I could no longer preach any of the dogmas which had
always been preached in the chapel, and I strove to avoid a
direct conflict by taking Scripture characters, amplifying them
from the hints in the Bible, and neglecting what was
supernatural.&nbsp; That I was allowed to go on for so long was
mainly due to the isolation of the town and the ignorance of my
hearers.&nbsp; Mardon and his daughter came frequently to hear
me, and this, I believe, finally roused suspicion more than any
doctrine expounded from the pulpit.&nbsp; One Saturday morning
there appeared the following letter in the <i>Sentinel</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Last
Sunday evening I happened to stray into a chapel not a hundred
miles from Water Lane.&nbsp; Sir, it was a lovely evening,
and</p>
<p>&lsquo;The glorious stars on high,<br />
Set like jewels in the sky,&rsquo;</p>
<p>were circling their courses, and, with the moon, irresistibly
reminded me of that blood which was shed for the remission of
sins.&nbsp; Sir, with my mind attuned in that direction I entered
the chapel.&nbsp; I hoped to hear something of that Rock of Ages
in which, as the poet sings, we shall wish to hide ourselves in
years to come.&nbsp; But, sir, a young man, evidently a young
man, occupied the pulpit, and great was my grief to find that the
tainted flood of human philosophy had rolled through the town and
was withering the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Years ago
that pulpit sent forth no uncertain sound, and the glorious
gospel was proclaimed there&mdash;not a <i>German gospel</i>,
sir&mdash;of our depravity and our salvation through Christ
Jesus.&nbsp; Sir, I should like to know what the dear departed
who endowed that chapel, and are asleep in the Lord in that
burying-ground, would say if they were to rise from their graves
and sit in those pews again and hear what I heard&mdash;a sermon
which might have been a week-day lecture.&nbsp; Sir, as I was
passing through the town, I could not feel that I had done my
duty without announcing to you the fact as above stated, and had
not raised a humble warning from&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sir, Yours truly,<br />
&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Christian
Traveller</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding the transparent artifice of the last
paragraph, there was no doubt that the author of this precious
production was Mr. Snale, and I at once determined to tax him
with it.&nbsp; On the Monday morning I called on him, and found
him in his shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Snale,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have a word or two
to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir.&nbsp; What a lovely day it is!&nbsp; I
hope you are very well, sir.&nbsp; Will you come
upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I declined to go upstairs, as it was probable I might meet
Mrs. Snale there.&nbsp; So I said that we had better go into the
counting-house, a little place boxed off at the end of the shop,
but with no door to it.&nbsp; As soon as we got in I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Snale, I have been much troubled by a letter which
has appeared in last week&rsquo;s <i>Sentinel</i>.&nbsp; Although
disguised, it evidently refers to me, and to be perfectly candid
with you, I cannot help thinking you wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, sir, may I ask <i>why</i> you think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The internal evidence, Mr. Snale, is overwhelming; but
if you did not write it, perhaps you will be good enough to say
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mr. Snale was a coward, but with a peculiarity which I
have marked in animals of the rat tribe.&nbsp; He would double
and evade as long as possible, but if he found there was no
escape, he would turn and tear and fight to the last
extremity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rutherford, that is rather&mdash;ground of an, of
an&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;of an assumptive nature on which
to make such an accusation, and I am not obliged to deny every
charge which you may be pleased to make against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Snale, do you then consider what I have
said is an accusation and charge?&nbsp; Do you think that it was
wrong to write such a letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I cannot exactly say that it was; but I must
say, sir, that I do think it peculiar of you, peculiar of you,
sir, to come here and attack one of your friends, who, I am sure,
has always showed you so much kindness&mdash;to attack him, sir,
with no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mr. Snale had not openly denied his authorship.&nbsp; But
the use of the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; was essentially a
lie&mdash;just one of those lies which, by avoiding the form of a
lie, have such a charm for a mind like his.&nbsp; I was roused to
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Snale, I will give you the proof which you want,
and then you shall judge for yourself.&nbsp; The letter contains
two lines of a hymn which you have misquoted.&nbsp; You made
precisely that blunder in talking to the Sunday-school children
on the Sunday before the letter appeared.&nbsp; You will remember
that in accordance with my custom to visit the Sunday-school
occasionally, I was there on that Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;ve not denied I did write
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denied you did write it!&rdquo; I exclaimed, with
gathering passion; &ldquo;what do you mean by the subterfuge
about your passing through the town and by your calling me your
friend a minute ago?&nbsp; What would you have thought if anybody
had written anonymously to the <i>Sentinel</i>, and had accused
you of selling short measure?&nbsp; You would have said it was a
libel, and you would also have said that a charge of that kind
ought to be made publicly and not anonymously.&nbsp; You seem to
think, nevertheless, that it is no sin to ruin me
anonymously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rutherford, I <i>am</i> sure I am your
friend.&nbsp; I wish you well, sir, both here&rdquo;&mdash;and
Mr. Snale tried to be very solemn&mdash;&ldquo;and in the world
to come.&nbsp; With regard to the letter, I don&rsquo;t see it as
you do, sir.&nbsp; But, sir, if you are going to talk in this
tone, I would advise you to be careful.&nbsp; We have heard,
sir&rdquo;&mdash;and here Mr. Snale began to simper and grin with
an indescribably loathsome grimace&mdash;&ldquo;that some of your
acquaintances in your native town are of opinion that you have
not behaved quite so well as you should have done to a certain
young lady of your acquaintance; and what is more, we have marked
with pain here, sir, your familiarity with an atheist and his
daughter, and we have noticed their coming to chapel, and we have
also noticed a change in your doctrine since these parties
attended there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; Mr. Snale grinned again,
apparently to somebody behind me, and I found that one of his
shopwomen had entered the counting-house, unobserved by me, while
this conversation was going on, and that she was smirking in
reply to Mr. Snale&rsquo;s signals.&nbsp; In a moment the blood
rushed to my brain.&nbsp; I was as little able to control myself
as if I had been shot suddenly down a precipice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Snale, you are a contemptible scoundrel and a
liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effort on him was comical.&nbsp; He cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, sir!&mdash;what do you mean, sir?&mdash;a
minister of the gospel&mdash;if you were not, I would&mdash;a
liar&rdquo;&mdash;and he swung round hastily on the stool on
which he was sitting, to get off and grasp a yard-measure which
stood against the fireplace.&nbsp; But the stool slipped, and he
came down ignominiously.&nbsp; I waited till he got up, but as he
rose a carriage stopped at the door, and he recognised one of his
best customers.&nbsp; Brushing the dust off his trousers, and
smoothing his hair, he rushed out without his hat, and in a
moment was standing obsequiously on the pavement, bowing to his
patron.&nbsp; I passed him in going out, but the oily film of
subserviency on his face was not broken for an instant.</p>
<p>When I got home I bitterly regretted what had happened.&nbsp;
I never regret anything more than the loss of self-mastery.&nbsp;
I had been betrayed, and yet I could not for the life of me see
how the betrayal could have been prevented.&nbsp; It was upon me
so suddenly, that before a moment had been given me for
reflection, the words were out of my mouth.&nbsp; I was
distinctly conscious that the <i>I</i> had not said those
words.&nbsp; They had been spoken by some other power working in
me which was beyond my reach.&nbsp; Nor could I foresee how to
prevent such a fall for the future.&nbsp; The only advice, even
now, which I can give to those who comprehend the bitter pangs of
such self-degradation as passion brings, is to watch the first
risings of the storm, and to say &ldquo;Beware; be
watchful,&rdquo; at the least indication of a tempest.&nbsp; Yet,
after every precaution, we are at the mercy of the elements, and
in an instant the sudden doubling of a cape may expose us, under
a serene sky, to a blast which, taking us with all sails spread,
may overset us and wreck us irretrievably.</p>
<p>My connection with the chapel was now obviously at an
end.&nbsp; I had no mind to be dragged before a church meeting,
and I determined to resign.&nbsp; After a little delay I wrote a
letter to the deacons, explaining that I had felt a growing
divergence from the theology taught heretofore in Water Lane, and
I wished consequently to give up my connection with them.&nbsp; I
received an answer stating that my resignation had been accepted;
I preached a farewell sermon; and I found myself one Monday
morning with a quarter&rsquo;s salary in my pocket, a few bills
to pay, and a blank outlook.</p>
<p>What was to be done?&nbsp; My first thought was towards
Unitarianism, but when I came to cast up the sum-total of what I
was assured, it seemed so ridiculously small that I was
afraid.&nbsp; The occupation of a merely miscellaneous lecturer
had always seemed to me very poor.&nbsp; I could not get up
Sunday after Sunday and retail to people little scraps suggested
by what I might have been studying during the week; and with
regard to the great subjects&mdash;for the exposition of which
the Christian minister specially exists&mdash;how much did I know
about them?&nbsp; The position of a minister who has a gospel to
proclaim; who can go out and tell men what they are to do to be
saved, was intelligible; but not so the position of a man who had
no such gospel.</p>
<p>What reason for continuance as a preacher could I claim?&nbsp;
Why should people hear me rather than read books?&nbsp; I was
alarmed to find, on making my reckoning, that the older I got the
less I appeared to believe.&nbsp; Nakeder and nakeder had I
become with the passage of every year, and I trembled to
anticipate the complete emptiness to which before long I should
be reduced.</p>
<p>What the dogma of immortality was to me I have already
described, and with regard to God I was no better.&nbsp; God was
obviously not a person in the clouds, and what more was really
firm under my feet than this&mdash;that the universe is governed
by immutable laws?&nbsp; These laws were not what is commonly
understood as God.&nbsp; Nor could I discern any ultimate
tendency in them.&nbsp; Everything was full of
contradiction.&nbsp; On the one hand was infinite misery; on the
other there were exquisite adaptations producing the highest
pleasure; on the one hand the mystery of life-long disease, and
on the other the equal mystery of the unspeakable glory of the
sunrise on a summer&rsquo;s morning over a quiet summer sea.</p>
<p>I happened to hear once an atheist discoursing on the follies
of theism.&nbsp; If he had made the world, he would have made it
much better.&nbsp; He would not have racked innocent souls with
years of torture, that tyrants might live in splendour.&nbsp; He
would not have permitted the earthquake to swallow up thousands
of harmless mortals, and so forth.&nbsp; But, putting aside all
dependence upon the theory of a coming rectification of such
wrongs as these, the atheist&rsquo;s argument was shallow
enough.</p>
<p>It would have been easy to show that a world such as he
imagines is unthinkable directly we are serious with our
conception of it.&nbsp; On whatever lines the world may be
framed, there must be distinction, difference, a higher and a
lower; and the lower, relatively to the higher, must always be an
evil.&nbsp; The scale upon which the higher and lower both are
makes no difference.&nbsp; The supremest bliss would not be bliss
if it were not definable bliss&mdash;that is to say, in the sense
that it has limits, marking it out from something else not so
supreme.&nbsp; Perfectly uninterrupted, infinite light, without
shadow, is a physical absurdity.&nbsp; I see a thing because it
is lighted, but also because of the differences of light, or, in
other words, because of shade, and without shade the universe
would be objectless, and in fact invisible.&nbsp; The atheist was
dreaming of shadowless light, a contradiction in terms.&nbsp;
Mankind may be improved, and the improvement may be infinite, and
yet good and evil must exist.&nbsp; So with death and life.&nbsp;
Life without death is not life, and death without life is equally
impossible.</p>
<p>But though all this came to me, and was not only a great
comfort to me, but prevented any shallow prating like that to
which I listened from this lecturer, it could not be said that it
was a gospel from which to derive apostolic authority.&nbsp;
There remained morals.&nbsp; I could become an instructor of
morality.&nbsp; I could warn tradesmen not to cheat, children to
honour their parents, and people generally not to lie.&nbsp; The
mission was noble, but I could not feel much enthusiasm for it,
and more than this, it was a fact that reformations in morals
have never been achieved by mere directions to be good, but have
always been the result of an enthusiasm for some City of God, or
some supereminent person.&nbsp; Besides, the people whom it was
most necessary to reach would not be the people who would,
unsolicited, visit a Unitarian meeting-house.&nbsp; As for a
message of negations, emancipating a number of persons from the
dogma of the Trinity or future punishment, and spending my
strength in merely demonstrating the nonsense of orthodoxy, my
soul sickened at the very thought of it.&nbsp; Wherein would men
be helped, and wherein should I be helped?</p>
<p>There were only two persons in the town who had ever been of
any service to me.&nbsp; One was Miss Arbour, and the other was
Mardon.&nbsp; But I shrank from Miss Arbour, because I knew that
my troubles had never been hers.&nbsp; She belonged to a past
generation, and as to Mardon, I never saw him without being aware
of the difficulty of accepting any advice from him.&nbsp; He was
perfectly clear, perfectly secular, and was so definitely shaped
and settled, that his line of conduct might always be predicted
beforehand with certainty.&nbsp; I knew very well what he thought
about preaching, and what he would tell me to do, or rather, what
he would tell me not to do.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after all, I was a victim to that weakness which
impels us to seek the assistance of others when we know that what
they offer will be of no avail.&nbsp; Accordingly, I called on
him.&nbsp; Both he and Mary were at home, and I was received with
more than usual cordiality.&nbsp; He knew already that I had
resigned, for the news was all over the town.&nbsp; I said I was
in great perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The perplexities of most persons arise,&rdquo; said
Mardon, &ldquo;as yours probably arise, from not understanding
exactly what you want to do.&nbsp; For one person who stumbles
and falls with a perfectly distinct object to be attained, I have
known a score whose disasters are to be attributed to their not
having made themselves certain what their aim is.&nbsp; You do
not know what you believe; consequently you do not know how to
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do if you were in my case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the whole business and prefer the meanest
handicraft.&nbsp; You have no right to be preaching anything
doubtful.&nbsp; You are aware what my creed is.&nbsp; I profess
no belief in God, and no belief in what hangs upon it.&nbsp; Try
and name now, any earnest conviction you possess, and see whether
you have a single one which I have not got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> believe in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing in that statement.&nbsp; What do you
believe about Him?&mdash;that is the point.&nbsp; You will find
that you believe nothing, in truth, which I do not also believe
of the laws which govern the universe and man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in an intellect of which these laws are the
expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what kind of an intellect can that be?&nbsp; You
can assign to it no character in accordance with its acts.&nbsp;
It is an intellect, if it be an intellect at all, which will
swallow up a city, and will create the music of Mozart for me
when I am weary; an intellect which brings to birth His Majesty
King George IV., and the love of an affectionate mother for her
child; an intellect which, in the person of a tender girl, shows
an exquisite conscience, and in the person of one or two
religious creatures whom I have known, shows a conscience almost
inverted.&nbsp; I have always striven to prove to my theological
friends that their mere affirmation of God is of no
consequence.&nbsp; They may be affirming anything or
nothing.&nbsp; The question, the all-important question is,
<i>What</i> can be affirmed about Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your side of the argument naturally admits of a more
precise statement than mine.&nbsp; I cannot encompass God with a
well-marked definition, but for all that, I believe in Him.&nbsp;
I know all that may be urged against the belief, but I cannot
help thinking that the man who looks upon the stars, or the
articulation of a leaf, is irresistibly impelled, unless he has
been corrupted by philosophy, to say, There is intellect
there.&nbsp; It is the instinct of the child and of the
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; but grant it, and again I ask,
<i>What</i> intellect is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again I say, I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why dispute?&nbsp; Why make such a fuss about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really seems to me of immense importance whether you
see this intellect or not, although you say it is of no
importance.&nbsp; It appears to be of less importance than it
really is, because I do not think that even you ever empty the
universe of intellect.&nbsp; I believe that mind never worships
anything but mind, and that you worship it when you admire the
level bars of cloud over the setting sun.&nbsp; You think you
eject mind, but you do not.&nbsp; I can only half imagine a
belief which looks upon the world as a mindless blank, and if I
could imagine it, it would be depressing in the last degree to
me.&nbsp; I know that I have mind, and to live in a universe in
which my mind is answered by no other would be unbearable.&nbsp;
Better any sort of intelligence than none at all.&nbsp; But, as I
have just said, your case admits of plainer statement than
mine.&nbsp; You and I have talked this matter over before, and I
have never gained a logical victory over you.&nbsp; Often I have
felt thoroughly prostrated by you, and yet, when I have left you,
the old superstition has arisen unsubdued.&nbsp; I do not know
how it is, but I always feel that upon this, as upon many other
subjects, I never can really speak myself.&nbsp; An unshapen
thought presents itself to me, I look at it, and I do all in my
power to give it body and expression, but I cannot.&nbsp; I am
certain that there is something truer and deeper to be said about
the existence of God than anything I have said, and what is more,
I am certain of the presence of this something in me, but I
cannot lift it to the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are now getting into the region of sentiment,
and I am unable to accompany you.&nbsp; When my friends go into
the clouds, I never try to follow them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time Mary had been sitting in the arm-chair against
the fireplace in her usual attitude, resting her head on her hand
and with her feet crossed one over the other on the fender.&nbsp;
She had been listening silently and motionless.&nbsp; She now
closed her eyes and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, father, it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is not true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not mean that what you have said about theology is
not true, but you make Mr. Rutherford believe you are what you
are not.&nbsp; Mr. Rutherford, father sometimes tells us he has
no sentiment, but you must take no notice of him when he talks in
that way.&nbsp; I always think of our visit to the seaside two
years ago.&nbsp; The railway-station was in a disagreeable part
of the town, and when we came out we walked along a dismal row of
very plain-looking houses.&nbsp; There were cards in the window
with &lsquo;Lodgings&rsquo; written on them, and father wanted to
go in to ask the terms.&nbsp; I said that I did not wish to stay
in such a dull street, but father could not afford to pay for a
sea view, and so we went in to inquire.&nbsp; We then found that
what we thought were the fronts of the houses were the backs, and
that the fronts faced the bay.&nbsp; They had pretty gardens on
the other side, and a glorious sunny prospect over the
ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mardon laughed and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mary, there is no sea front here, and no
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took up my hat and said I must go.&nbsp; Both pressed me to
stop, but I declined.&nbsp; Mardon urged me again, and at last
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve never once heard Mary
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary protested, and pleaded that as they had no piano, Mr.
Rutherford would not care for her poor voice without any
accompaniment.&nbsp; But I, too, protested that I should, and she
got out the &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her father took a
tuning-fork out of his pocket, and having struck it, Mary rose
and began, &ldquo;He was despised.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice was not
powerful, but it was pure and clear, and she sang with that
perfect taste which is begotten solely of a desire to honour the
Master.&nbsp; The song always had a profound charm for me.&nbsp;
Partly this was due to association.&nbsp; The words and tones,
which have been used to embody their emotions by those whom we
have loved, are doubly expressive when we use them to embody our
own.&nbsp; The song is potent too, because with utmost musical
tenderness and strength it reveals the secret of the influence of
the story of Jesus.&nbsp; Nobody would be bold enough to cry,
<i>That too is my case</i>, and yet the poorest and the humblest
soul has a right to the consolation that Jesus was a man of
sorrows and acquainted with grief.</p>
<p>For some reason or the other, or for many reasons,
Mary&rsquo;s voice wound itself into the very centre of my
existence.&nbsp; I seemed to be listening to the tragedy of all
human worth and genius.&nbsp; The ball rose in my throat, the
tears mounted to my eyes, and I had to suppress myself
rigidly.</p>
<p>Presently she ceased.&nbsp; There was silence for a
moment.&nbsp; I looked round, and saw that Mardon&rsquo;s face
was on the table, buried in his hands.&nbsp; I felt that I had
better go, for the presence of a stranger, when the heart is
deeply stirred, is an intrusion.&nbsp; I noiselessly left the
room, and Mary followed.&nbsp; When we got to the door she said:
&ldquo;I forgot that mother used to sing that song.&nbsp; I ought
to have known better.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her own eyes were full; I
thought the pressure of her hand as she bade me good-bye was a
little firmer than usual, and as we parted an over-mastering
impulse seized me.&nbsp; I lifted her hand to my lips; without
giving her time to withdraw it, I gave it one burning kiss, and
passed out into the street.&nbsp; It was pouring with rain, and I
had neither overcoat nor umbrella, but I heeded not the heavens,
and not till I got home to my own fireless, dark, solitary
lodgings, did I become aware of any contrast between the sphere
into which I had been exalted and the earthly commonplace world
by which I was surrounded.</p>

173</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EMANCIPATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Presbyterian chapels
throughout the country have many of them become Unitarian, and
occasionally, even in an agricultural village, a respectable
red-brick building may be seen, dating from the time of Queen
Anne, in which a few descendants of the eighteenth century
heretics still testify against three Gods in one and the deity of
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the attendance in these
chapels is very meagre, but they are often endowed, and so they
are kept open.</p>
<p>There was one in the large, straggling half-village, half-town
of D-, within about ten miles of me, and the pulpit was then
vacant.&nbsp; The income was about &pound;100 a year.&nbsp; The
principal man there was a small general dealer, who kept a shop
in the middle of the village street, and I had come to know him
slightly, because I had undertaken to give his boy a few lessons
to prepare him for admission to a boarding-school.&nbsp; The
money in my pocket was coming to an end, and as I did not suppose
that any dishonesty would be imposed on me, and although the
prospect were not cheering, I expressed my willingness to be
considered as a candidate.</p>
<p>In the course of a week or two I was therefore invited to
preach.&nbsp; I was so reduced that I was obliged to walk the
whole distance on the Sunday morning, and as I was asked to no
house, I went straight to the chapel, and loitered about in the
graveyard till a woman came and opened a door at the back.&nbsp;
I explained who I was, and sat down in a Windsor chair against a
small kitchen table in the vestry.&nbsp; It was cold, but there
was no fire, nor were any preparations made for one.&nbsp; On the
mantel-shelf were a bottle of water and a glass, but as the water
had evidently been there for some time, it was not very
tempting.</p>
<p>I waited in silence for about twenty minutes, and my friend
the dealer then came in, and having shaken hands, and remarked
that it was chilly, asked me for the hymns.&nbsp; These I gave
him, and went into the pulpit.&nbsp; I found myself in a
plain-looking building designed to hold about two hundred
people.&nbsp; There was a gallery opposite me, and the floor was
occupied with high, dark, brown pews, one or two immediately on
my right and left being surrounded with faded green
curtains.&nbsp; I counted my hearers, and discovered that there
were exactly seventeen, including two very old labourers, who sat
on a form near the door.&nbsp; The gallery was quite empty,
except a little organ, or seraphine, I think it was called, which
was played by a young woman.&nbsp; The dealer gave out the hymns,
and accompanied the seraphine in a bass voice, singing the
air.&nbsp; A weak whisper might be perceived from the rest of the
congregation, but nothing more.</p>
<p>I was somewhat taken aback at finding in the Bible a discourse
which had been left by one of my predecessors.&nbsp; It was a
funeral-sermon, neatly written, and had evidently done duty on
several occasions, although the allusions in it might be
considered personal.&nbsp; The piety and good works of the
departed were praised with emphasis, but the masculine pronouns
originally used were altered above the lines all throughout to
feminine pronouns, and the word &ldquo;brother&rdquo; to
&ldquo;sister,&rdquo; so that no difficulty might arise in
reading it for either sex.&nbsp; I was faint, benumbed, and with
no heart for anything.&nbsp; I talked for about half-an-hour
about what I considered to be the real meaning of the death of
Christ, thinking that this was a subject which might prove as
attractive as any other.</p>
<p>After the service the assembly of seventeen departed, save one
thin elderly gentleman, who came into the vestry, and having made
a slight bow, said: &ldquo;Mr. Rutherford, will you come with me,
if you please?&rdquo;&nbsp; I accordingly followed him, almost in
silence, through the village till we reached his house, where his
wife, who had gone on before, received us.&nbsp; They had
formerly kept the shop which the dealer now had, but had
retired.&nbsp; They might both be about sixty-five, and were of
about the same temperament, pale, thin, and ineffectual, as if
they had been fed on gruel.</p>
<p>We had dinner in a large room with an old-fashioned grate in
it, in which was stuck a basket stove.&nbsp; I remember perfectly
well what we had for dinner.&nbsp; There was a neck of mutton
(cold), potatoes, cabbage, a suet pudding, and some of the
strangest-looking ale I ever saw&mdash;about the colour of lemon
juice, but what it was really like I do not know, as I did not
drink beer.&nbsp; I was somewhat surprised at being asked whether
I would take potatoes <i>or</i> cabbage, but thinking it was the
custom of the country not to indulge in both at once, and
remembering that I was on probation, I said
&ldquo;cabbage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very little was spoken during dinner-time by anybody, and
scarcely a word by my hostess.&nbsp; After dinner she cleared the
things away, and did not again appear.&nbsp; My host drew near
the basket stove, and having remarked that it was beginning to
rain, fell into a slumber.&nbsp; At twenty minutes to two we
sallied out for the afternoon service, and found the seventeen
again in their places, excepting the two labourers, who were
probably prevented by the wet from attending.</p>
<p>The service was a repetition of that in the morning, and when
I came down my host again came forward and presented me with
nineteen shillings.&nbsp; The fee was a guinea, but from that two
shillings were abated for my entertainment.&nbsp; He informed me
at the same time that a farmer, who had been hearing me and who
lived five miles on my road, would give me a lift.&nbsp; He was a
very large, stout man, with a rosy countenance, which was
somewhat of a relief after the gruel face of my former
friend.&nbsp; We went round to a stable-yard, and I got into a
four-wheeled chaise.&nbsp; His wife sat with him in front, and a
biggish boy sat with me behind.</p>
<p>When we came to a guide-post which pointed down his lane, I
got out, and was dismissed in the dark with the
observation&mdash;uttered good-naturedly and jovially, but not
very helpfully&mdash;that he was &ldquo;afraid I should have a
wettish walk.&rdquo;&nbsp; The walk certainly was wettish, and as
I had had nothing to eat or drink since my midday meal, I was
miserable and desponding.&nbsp; But just before I reached home
the clouds rolled off with the south-west wind into detached,
fleecy masses, separated by liquid blue gulfs, in which were
sowed the stars, and the effect upon me was what that sight,
thank God, always has been&mdash;a sense of the infinite,
extinguishing all mean cares.</p>
<p>I expected to hear no more from my Unitarian acquaintances,
and was therefore greatly surprised when, a week after my visit,
I received an invitation to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; amongst
them.&nbsp; The usual month&rsquo;s trial was thought
unnecessary, as I was not altogether a stranger to some of
them.&nbsp; I hardly knew what to do, I could not feel any
enthusiasm at the prospect of the engagement, but, on the other
hand, there was nothing else before me.&nbsp; There is no more
helpless person in this world than a minister who is thrown out
of work.&nbsp; At any rate, I should be doing no harm if I
went.</p>
<p>I pondered over the matter a good deal, and then reflected
that in a case where every opening is barred save one, it is our
duty not to plunge at an impassable barrier, but to take that one
opening, however unpromising it may be.&nbsp; Accordingly I
accepted.&nbsp; My income was to be a hundred a year, and it was
proposed that I should lodge with my friend the retired dealer,
who had the only two rooms in the village which were
available.</p>
<p>I went to bid Mardon and Mary good-bye.&nbsp; I had not seen
either of them since the night of the song.&nbsp; To my surprise
I found them both away.&nbsp; The blinds were down and the door
locked.&nbsp; A neighbour, who heard me knocking, came out and
told me the news.&nbsp; Mardon had had a dispute with his
employer, and had gone to London to look for work.&nbsp; Mary had
gone to see a relative at some distance, and would remain there
until her father had determined what was to be done.</p>
<p>I obtained the addresses of both of them, and wrote to Mardon,
telling him what my destiny for the present was to be.&nbsp; To
Mary I wrote also, and to her I offered my heart.&nbsp; Looking
backward, I have sometimes wondered that I felt so little
hesitation; not that I have ever doubted since, that what I did
then was the one perfectly right thing which I have done in my
life, but because it was my habit so to confuse myself with
meditative indecision.&nbsp; I had doubted before.&nbsp; I
remember once being so near engaging myself to a girl that the
desk was open and the paper under my hand.&nbsp; But I held back,
could not make up my mind, and happily was stayed.&nbsp; Had I
not been restrained, I should for ever have been miserable.&nbsp;
The remembrance of this escape, and the certain knowledge that of
all beings whom I knew I was most likely to be mistaken in an
emergency, always produced in me a torturing tendency to
inaction.&nbsp; There was no such tendency now.&nbsp; I thought I
chose Mary, but there was no choice.&nbsp; The feeblest steel
filing which is drawn to a magnet, would think, if it had
consciousness, that it went to the magnet of its own free
will.&nbsp; My soul rushed to hers as if dragged by the force of
a loadstone.</p>
<p>But she was not to be mine.&nbsp; I had a note from her, a
sweet note, thanking me with much tenderness for my affectionate
regard for her, but saying that her mind had long since been made
up.&nbsp; She was an only child of a mother whom her father had
loved above everything in life, and she could never leave him nor
suffer any affection to interfere with that which she felt for
him and which he felt for her.&nbsp; I might well misinterpret
him, and think it strange that he should be so much bound up in
her.&nbsp; Few people knew him as she did.</p>
<p>The shock to me at first was overpowering, and I fell under
the influence of that horrible monomania from which I had been
free for so long.&nbsp; For weeks I was prostrate, with no power
of resistance; the evil being intensified by my solitude.&nbsp;
Of all the dreadful trials which human nature has the capacity to
bear unshattered, the worst&mdash;as, indeed, I have already
said&mdash;is the fang of some monomaniacal idea which cannot be
wrenched out.&nbsp; A main part of the misery, as I have also
said, lies in the belief that suffering of this kind is peculiar
to ourselves.&nbsp; We are afraid to speak of it, and not
knowing, therefore, how common it is, we are distracted with the
fear that it is our own special disease.</p>
<p>I managed to get through my duties, but how I cannot
tell.&nbsp; Fortunately our calamities are not what they appear
to be when they lie in perspective behind us or before us, for
they actually consist of distinct moments, each of which is
overcome by itself.&nbsp; I was helped by remembering my recovery
before, and I was able now, as a reward of long-continued
abstinence from wine, to lie much stiller, and wait with more
patience till the cloud should lift.</p>
<p>Mardon having gone to London, I was more alone than ever, but
my love for Mary increased in intensity, and had a good deal to
do with my restoration to health.&nbsp; It was a hopeless love,
but to be in love hopelessly is more akin to sanity than
careless, melancholy indifference to the world.&nbsp; I was
relieved from myself by the anchorage of all my thoughts
elsewhere.&nbsp; The pain of loss was great, but the main curse
of my existence has not been pain or loss, but gloom; blind
wandering in a world of black fog, haunted by apparitions.&nbsp;
I am not going to expand upon the history of my silent
relationship to Mary during that time.&nbsp; How can I?&nbsp; All
that I felt has been described better by others; and if it had
not been, I have no mind to attempt a description myself, which
would answer no purpose.</p>
<p>I continued to correspond with Mardon, but with Mary I
interchanged no word.&nbsp; After her denial of me I should have
dreaded the charge of selfishness if I had opened my lips
again.&nbsp; I could not place myself in her affection before her
father.</p>
<p>My work at the chapel was of the most lifeless kind.&nbsp; My
people really consisted of five families&mdash;those of the
retired dealer, the farmer who took me home the first day I
preached, and a man who kept a shop in the village for the sale
of all descriptions of goods, including ready-made clothing and
provisions.&nbsp; He had a wife and one child.</p>
<p>Then there was a super-annuated brass-founder, who had a large
house near, and who nominally was a Unitarian, having professed
himself a Unitarian in the town in which he was formerly in
business, where Unitarianism was flourishing.&nbsp; He had come
down here to cultivate, for amusement, a few acres of ground, and
play the squire at a cheap rate.&nbsp; Released from active
employment, he had given himself over to eating and drinking,
particularly the drinking of port wine.&nbsp; His wife was dead,
his sons were in business for themselves, and his daughters all
went to church.&nbsp; His connection with the chapel was merely
nominal, and I was very glad it was so.&nbsp; I was hardly ever
brought into contact with him, except as trustee, and once I was
asked to his house to dinner; but the attempt to make me feel my
inferiority was so painful, and the rudeness of his children was
so marked, that I never went again.</p>
<p>There was also a schoolmaster, who kept a low-priced
boarding-school with a Unitarian connection.&nbsp; He lived,
however, at such a distance that his visits were very
unfrequent.&nbsp; Sometimes on a fine summer&rsquo;s Sunday
morning the boys would walk over&mdash;about twenty of them
altogether, but this only happened perhaps half-a-dozen times in
a year.</p>
<p>Although my congregation had a freethought lineage, I do not
think that I ever had anything to do with a more petrified
set.&nbsp; With one exception, they were meagre in the
extreme.&nbsp; They were perfectly orthodox, except that they
denied a few orthodox doctrines.&nbsp; Their method was as strict
as that of the most rigid Calvinist.&nbsp; They plumed
themselves, however, greatly on their intellectual superiority
over the Wesleyans and Baptists round them; and so far as I could
make out, the only topics they delighted in were demonstrations
of the unity of God from texts in the Bible, and polemics against
tri-theism.&nbsp; Sympathy with the great problems then beginning
to agitate men they had none.&nbsp; Socially they were cold, and
the entertainment at their houses was pale and penurious.&nbsp;
They never considered themselves bound to contribute a shilling
to my support.&nbsp; There was an endowment of a hundred a year,
and they were relieved from all further anxiety.&nbsp; They had
no enthusiasm for their chapel, and came or stayed away on the
Sunday just as it suited them, and without caring to assign any
reason.</p>
<p>The one exception was the wife of the shopkeeper.&nbsp; She
was a contrast to her husband and all the rest.&nbsp; I do not
think she was a Unitarian born and bred.&nbsp; She talked but
little about theology, but she was devoted to her Bible, and had
a fine sense for all the passages in it which had an experience
in them.&nbsp; She was generous, spiritual, and possessed of an
unswerving instinct for what was right.&nbsp; Oftentimes her
prompt decisions were a scandal to her more sedate friends, who
did not believe in any way of arriving at the truth except by
rationalising, but she hardly ever failed to hit the mark.&nbsp;
It was in questions of relationship between persons, of
behaviour, and of morals, that her guidance was the surest.&nbsp;
In such cases her force seemed to keep her straight, while the
weakness of those around made it impossible for them not to
wander, first on one side and then on the other.&nbsp; She was
unflinching in her expressions, and at any sacrifice did her
duty.&nbsp; It was her severity in obeying her conscience which
not only gave authority to her admonitions, but was the source of
her inspirations.</p>
<p>She was not much of a reader, but she read strange
things.&nbsp; She had some old volumes of a magazine&mdash;a
&ldquo;Repository&rdquo; of some kind; I have forgotten
what&mdash;and she picked out from them some translations of
German verses which she greatly admired.&nbsp; She was not a well
educated woman in the school sense of the word, and of several of
our greatest names in literature had heard nothing.&nbsp; I do
not think she knew anything about Shakespeare, and she never
entered into the meaning of dramatic poetry.&nbsp; At all points
her path was her own, intersecting at every conceivable angle the
paths of her acquaintances, and never straying along them except
just so far as they might happen to be hers.</p>
<p>While I was in the village an event happened which caused much
commotion.&nbsp; Her son was serving in the shop, and there was
in the house at the time a nice-looking, clean
servant-girl.&nbsp; Mrs. Lane, for that was my friend&rsquo;s
name, had meditated discharging her, for, with her usual
quickness, she thought she saw something in the behaviour of her
son to the girl which was peculiar.&nbsp; One morning, however,
both her son and the girl were absent, and there was a letter
upon the table announcing that they were in a town about twenty
miles off and were married.</p>
<p>The shock was great, and a tumult of voices arose, confusing
counsel.&nbsp; Mrs. Lane said but little, but never wavered an
instant.&nbsp; Leaving her husband to &ldquo;consider what was
best to be done,&rdquo; she got out the gig, drove herself over
to her son&rsquo;s lodging, and presented herself to her amazed
daughter-in-law, who fell upon her knees and prayed for
pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lane, &ldquo;get up
this instant; you are my daughter.&nbsp; Not another word.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve come to see what you want.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she kissed
her tenderly.&nbsp; The girl was at heart a good girl.&nbsp; She
was so bound to her late mistress and her new mother by this
behaviour, that the very depth in her opened, and she loved Mrs.
Lane ever afterwards with almost religious fervour.&nbsp; She was
taught a little up to her son&rsquo;s level, and a happier
marriage I never knew.&nbsp; Mrs. Lane told me what she had done,
but she had no theory about it.&nbsp; She merely said she knew it
to be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>She was very fond of getting up early in the morning and going
out, and in such a village this was an eccentricity bordering
almost on lunacy.&nbsp; At five o&rsquo;clock she was often
wandering about her garden.&nbsp; She was a great lover of order
in the house, and kept it well under control, but I do not think
I ever surprised her when she was so busy that she would not
easily, and without any apparent sacrifice, leave what she was
doing to come and talk with me.</p>
<p>As I have said, the world of books in which I lived was almost
altogether shut to her, but yet she was the only person in the
village whose conversation was lifted out of the petty and
personal into the region of the universal.&nbsp; I have been thus
particular in describing her&mdash;I fear without raising any
image of her&mdash;because she was of incalculable service to
me.&nbsp; I languished from lack of life, and her mere presence,
so exuberant in its full vivacity, was like mountain air.&nbsp;
Furthermore, she was not troubled much with my philosophical
difficulties.&nbsp; They had not come in her path.&nbsp; Her
world was the world of men and women&mdash;more particularly of
those she knew&mdash;and it was a world in which it did me good
to dwell.&nbsp; She was all the more important to me, because
outside our own little circle there was no society
whatever.&nbsp; The Church and the other Dissenting bodies
considered us non-Christian.</p>
<p>I often wondered that Mr. Lane retained his business, and,
indeed, he would have lost it if he had not established a
reputation for honesty, which drew customers to him, who,
notwithstanding the denunciations of the parson, preferred tea
with some taste in it from a Unitarian to the insipid
wood-flavoured stuff which was sold by the grocer who believed in
the Trinity.</p>

194</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PROGRESS IN EMANCIPATION</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> with my Unitarian
congregation for about a twelvemonth.&nbsp; My life during that
time, save so far as my intercourse with Mrs. Lane, and one other
friend presently to be mentioned, was concerned, was as sunless
and joyless as it had ever been.&nbsp; Imagine me living by
myself, roaming about the fields, and absorbed mostly upon
insoluble problems with which I never made any progress, and
which tended to draw me away from what enjoyment of life there
was which I might have had.</p>
<p>One day I was walking along under the south side of a hill,
which was a great place for butterflies, and I saw a man,
apparently about fifty years old, coming along with a
butterfly-net.&nbsp; He did not see me, for he looked about for a
convenient piece of turf, and presently sat down, taking out a
sandwich-box, from which he produced his lunch.&nbsp; His
occupation did not particularly attract me, but in those days, if
I encountered a new person who was not repulsive, I was always as
eager to make his acquaintance as if he perchance might solve a
secret for me, the answer to which I burned to know.&nbsp; I have
been disappointed so many times, and have found that nobody has
much more to tell me, that my curiosity has somewhat abated, but
even now, the news that anybody who has the reputation for
intelligence has come near me, makes me restless to see
him.&nbsp; I accordingly saluted the butterfly-catcher, who
returned the salutation kindly, and we began to talk.</p>
<p>He told me that he had come seven miles that morning to that
spot because he knew that it was haunted by one particular
species of butterfly which he wished to get; and as it was a
still, bright day, he hoped to find a specimen.&nbsp; He had been
unsuccessful for some years.&nbsp; Presupposing that I knew all
about his science, he began to discourse upon it with great
freedom, and he ended by saying that he would be happy to show me
his collection, which was one of the finest in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I forget,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I always forget
in such cases, perhaps you don&rsquo;t care for
butterflies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take much interest in them.&nbsp; I admire
exceedingly the beauty of their colours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, but you don&rsquo;t care for them
scientifically, or for collecting them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not particularly.&nbsp; I cannot say I ever saw
much pleasure in the mere classification of insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are devoted to some other
science?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I daresay it looks absurd for a man at my years
to be running after a moth.&nbsp; I used to think it was absurd,
but I am wiser now.&nbsp; However, I cannot stop to talk; I shall
lose the sunshine.&nbsp; The first time you are anywhere near me,
come and have a look.&nbsp; You will alter your
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some weeks afterwards I happened to be in the neighbourhood of
the butterfly-catcher&rsquo;s house, and I called.&nbsp; He was
at home, and welcomed me cordially.&nbsp; The first thing he did
was to show me his little museum.&nbsp; It was really a wonderful
exhibition, and as I saw the creatures in lines, and noted the
amazing variations of the single type, I was filled with
astonishment.&nbsp; Seeing the butterflies systematically
arranged was a totally different thing from seeing a butterfly
here and there, and gave rise to altogether new thoughts.&nbsp;
My friend knew his subject from end to end, and I envied him his
mastery of it.&nbsp; I had often craved the mastery of some one
particular province, be it ever so minute.&nbsp; I half or a
quarter knew a multitude of things, but no one thing thoroughly,
and was never sure, just when I most wanted to be sure.&nbsp; We
got into conversation, and I was urged to stay to dinner.&nbsp; I
consented, and found that my friend&rsquo;s household consisted
of himself alone.&nbsp; After dinner, as we became a little more
communicative, I asked him when and how he took to this
pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be twenty-six years ago next Christmas,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;since I suffered a great calamity.&nbsp; You will
forgive my saying anything about it, as I have no assurance that
the wound which looks healed may not break out again.&nbsp;
Suffice to say, that for some ten years or more my thoughts were
almost entirely occupied with death and our future state.&nbsp;
There is a strange fascination about these topics to many people,
because they are topics which permit a great deal of dreaming,
but very little thinking: in fact, true thinking, in the proper
sense of the word, is impossible in dealing with them.&nbsp;
There is no rigorous advance from one position to another, which
is really all that makes thinking worth the name.&nbsp; Every man
can imagine or say cloudy things about death and the future, and
feel himself here, at least, on a level with the ablest brain
which he knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went on gazing gloomily into dark emptiness, till all
life became nothing for me.&nbsp; I did not care to live, because
there was no assurance of existence beyond.&nbsp; By the
strangest of processes, I neglected the world, because I had so
short a time to be in it.&nbsp; It is with absolute horror now
that I look back upon those days, when I lay as if alive in a
coffin of lead.&nbsp; All passions and pursuits were nullified by
the ever-abiding sense of mortality.&nbsp; For years this mood
endured, and I was near being brought down to the very dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, by the greatest piece of good fortune, I was
obliged to go abroad.&nbsp; The change, and the obligation to
occupy myself about many affairs, was an incalculable blessing to
me.&nbsp; While travelling I was struck with the remarkable and
tropical beauty of the insects, and especially of the
butterflies.&nbsp; I captured a few, and brought them home.&nbsp;
On showing them to a friend, learned in such matters, I
discovered that they were rare, and I had a little cabinet made
for them.&nbsp; I looked into the books, found what it was which
I had got, and what I had not got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next year it was my duty to go abroad again, and I went
with some feeling akin to pleasure, for I wished to add to my
store.&nbsp; I increased it considerably, and by the time I
returned I had as fine a show as any private person might wish to
possess.&nbsp; A good deal of my satisfaction, perhaps, was
unaccountable, and no rational explanation can be given of
it.&nbsp; But men should not be too curious in analysing and
condemning any means which Nature devises to save them from
themselves, whether it be coins, old books, curiosities,
butterflies, or fossils.&nbsp; And yet my newly-acquired passion
was not altogether inexplicable.&nbsp; I was the owner of
something which other persons did not own, and in a little while,
in my own limited domain, I was supreme.&nbsp; No man either can
study any particular science thoroughly without transcending it;
and it is an utter mistake to suppose that, because a student
sticks to any one branch, he necessarily becomes contracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I am not going to philosophise; I do not like
it.&nbsp; All I can say is, that I shun all those metaphysical
speculations of former years as I would a path which leads to
madness.&nbsp; Other people may be able to occupy themselves with
them and be happy; I cannot.&nbsp; I find quite enough in my
butterflies to exercise my wonder, and yet, on the other hand, my
study is not a mere vacant, profitless stare.&nbsp; When you saw
me that morning, I was trying to obtain an example which I have
long wanted to fill up a gap.&nbsp; I have looked for it for
years, but have missed it.&nbsp; But I know it has been seen
lately where we met, and I shall triumph at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good deal of all this was to me incomprehensible.&nbsp; It
seemed mere solemn trifling compared with the investigation of
those great questions with which I had been occupied, but I could
not resist the contagion of my friend&rsquo;s enthusiasm when he
took me to his little library and identified his treasures with
pride, pointing out at the same time those in which he was
deficient.&nbsp; He was specially exultant over one minute
creature which he had caught himself, which he had not as yet
seen figured, and he proposed going to the British Museum almost
on purpose to see if he could find it there.</p>
<p>When I got home I made inquiries into the history of my
entomologist.&nbsp; I found that years ago he had married a
delicate girl, of whom he was devotedly fond.&nbsp; She died in
childbirth, leaving him completely broken.&nbsp; Her offspring, a
boy, survived, but he was a cripple, and grew up deformed.&nbsp;
As he neared manhood he developed a satyr-like lustfulness, which
was almost uncontrollable, and made it difficult to keep him at
home without constraint.&nbsp; He seemed to have no natural
affection for his father, nor for anybody else, but was cunning
with the base, beastly cunning of the ape.&nbsp; The
father&rsquo;s horror was infinite.&nbsp; This thing was his only
child, and the child of the woman whom he worshipped.&nbsp; He
was excluded from all intercourse with friends; for, as the boy
could not be said to be mad, he could not be shut up.&nbsp; After
years of inconceivable misery, however, lust did deepen into
absolute lunacy, and the crooked, misshapen monster was carried
off to an asylum, where he died, and the father well-nigh went
there too.</p>
<p>Before I had been six months amongst the Unitarians, I found
life even more intolerable with them than it had been with the
Independents.&nbsp; The difference of a little less belief was
nothing.&nbsp; The question of Unitarianism was altogether dead
to me; and although there was a phase of the doctrine of
God&rsquo;s unity which would now and then give me an opportunity
for a few words which I felt, it was not a phase for which my
hearers in the least cared or which they understood.</p>
<p>Here, as amongst the Independents, there was the same lack of
personal affection, or even of a capability of it&mdash;excepting
always Mrs. Lane&mdash;and, in fact, it was more distressing
amongst the Unitarians than amongst the orthodox.&nbsp; The
desire for something like sympathy and love absolutely devoured
me.&nbsp; I dwelt on all the instances in poetry and history in
which one human being had been bound to another human being, and
I reflected that my existence was of no earthly importance to
anybody.&nbsp; I could not altogether lay the blame on
myself.&nbsp; God knows that I would have stood against a wall
and have been shot for any man or woman whom I loved, as
cheerfully as I would have gone to bed, but nobody seemed to wish
for such a love, or to know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Oh, the humiliations under which this weakness has bent
me!&nbsp; Often and often I have thought that I have discovered
somebody who could really comprehend the value of a passion which
could tell everything and venture everything.&nbsp; I have
overstepped all bounds of etiquette in obtruding myself on him,
and have opened my heart even to shame.&nbsp; I have then found
that it was all on my side.&nbsp; For every dozen times I went to
his house, he came to mine once, and only when pressed: I have
languished in sickness for a month without his finding it out;
and if I were to drop into the grave, he would perhaps never give
me another thought.&nbsp; If I had been born a hundred years
earlier, I should have transferred this burning longing to the
unseen God and have become a devotee.&nbsp; But I was a hundred
years too late, and I felt that it was mere cheating of myself
and a mockery to think about love for the only God whom I
knew&mdash;the forces which maintained the universe.</p>
<p>I am now getting old, and have altered in many things.&nbsp;
The hunger and thirst of those years have abated, or rather, the
fire has had ashes heaped on it, so that it is well-nigh
extinguished.&nbsp; I have been repulsed into self-reliance and
reserve, having learned wisdom by experience; but still I know
that the desire has not died, as so many other desires have died,
by the natural evolution of age.&nbsp; It has been forcibly
suppressed, and that is all.&nbsp; If anybody who reads these
words of mine should be offered by any young dreamer such a
devotion as I once had to offer, and had to take back again
refused so often, let him in the name of all that is sacred
accept it.&nbsp; It is simply the most precious thing in
existence.&nbsp; Had I found anybody who would have thought so,
my life would have been redeemed into something which I have
often imagined, but now shall never know.</p>
<p>I determined to leave, but what to do I could not tell.&nbsp;
I was fit for nothing, and yet I could not make up my mind to
accept a life which was simply living.&nbsp; It must be a life,
through which some benefit was conferred upon my
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; This was mainly delusion.&nbsp; I had not
then learned to correct this natural instinct to be of some
service to mankind by the thought of the boundlessness of
infinity and of Nature&rsquo;s profuseness.&nbsp; I had not come
to reflect that, taking into account her eternities, and absolute
exhaustlessness, it was folly in me to fret and fume, and I
therefore clung to the hope that I might employ myself in some
way which, however feebly, would help mankind a little to the
realisation of an ideal.&nbsp; But I was not the man for such a
mission.&nbsp; I lacked altogether that concentration which binds
up the scattered powers into one resistless energy, and I lacked
faith.&nbsp; All I could do was to play the vagrant in
literature, picking up here and there an idea which attracted me,
and presenting it to my flock on the Sunday; the net result being
next to nothing.</p>
<p>However, existence like that which I had been leading was
intolerable, and change it I must.&nbsp; I accordingly resigned,
and with ten pounds in my pocket, which was all that remained
after paying my bills, I came to London, thinking that until I
could settle what to do, I would try and teach in a school.&nbsp;
I called on an agent somewhere near the Strand, and after a
little negotiation, was engaged by a gentleman who kept a private
establishment at Stoke Newington.</p>
<p>Thither I accordingly went one Monday afternoon in January,
about two days before the term commenced.&nbsp; When I got there,
I was shown into a long schoolroom, which had been built out from
the main building.&nbsp; It was dark, save for one candle, and
was warmed by a stove.&nbsp; The walls were partly covered with
maps, and at one end of the room hung a diagram representing a
globe, on which an immense amount of wasted ingenuity had been
spent to produce the illusion of solidity.&nbsp; The master, I
was told, was out, and in this room with one candle I remained
till nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At that time a servant brought me
some bread and cheese on a small tray, with half-a-pint of
beer.&nbsp; I asked for water, which was given me, and she then
retired.&nbsp; The tray was set down on the master&rsquo;s raised
desk, and sitting there I ate my supper in silence, looking down
upon the dimly-lighted forms, and forward into the almost
absolute gloom.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock a man, who seemed as if he were the knife
and boot-cleaner, came and said he would show me where I was to
sleep.&nbsp; We passed through the schoolroom into a kind of
court, where there was a ladder standing against a
trap-door.&nbsp; He told me that my bedroom was up there, and
that when I got up I could leave the ladder down, or pull it up
after me, just as I pleased.</p>
<p>I ascended and found a little chamber, duly furnished with a
chest of drawers, bed, and washhand-stand.&nbsp; It was tolerably
clean and decent; but who shall describe what I felt!&nbsp; I
went to the window and looked out.&nbsp; There were scattered
lights here and there, marking roads, but as they crossed one
another, and now and then stopped where building had ceased, the
effect they produced was that of bewilderment with no clue to
it.&nbsp; Further off was the great light of London, like some
unnatural dawn, or the illumination from a fire which could not
itself be seen.&nbsp; I was overcome with the most dreadful sense
of loneliness.&nbsp; I suppose it is the very essence of passion,
using the word in its literal sense, that no account can be given
of it by the reason.</p>
<p>Reflecting on what I suffered, then, I cannot find any solid
ground for it, and yet there are not half-a-dozen days or nights
of my life which remain with me like that one.&nbsp; I was beside
myself with a kind of terror, which I cannot further
explain.&nbsp; It is possible for another person to understand
grief for the death of a friend, bodily suffering, or any emotion
which has a distinct cause, but how shall he understand the worst
of all calamities, the nameless dread, the efflux of all
vitality, the ghostly, haunting horror which is so nearly akin to
madness?</p>
<p>It is many years ago since that evening, but while I write I
am at the window still, and the yellow flare of the city is still
in my eyes.&nbsp; I remember the thought of all the happy homes
which lay around me, in which dwelt men who had found a position,
an occupation, and, above all things, affection.&nbsp; I know the
causelessness of a good deal of all those panic fears and all
that suffering, but I tremble to think how thin is the floor on
which we stand which separates us from the bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>The next morning I went down into the schoolroom, and after I
had been there for some little time, the proprietor of the school
made his appearance.&nbsp; He was not a bad man, nor even unkind
in his way, but he was utterly uninteresting, and as commonplace
as might be expected after having for many years done nothing but
fight a very uphill battle in boarding the sons of tradesfolk,
and teaching them, at very moderate rates, the elements of Latin,
and the various branches of learning which constitute what is
called a commercial education.&nbsp; He said that he expected
some of the boys back that day; that when they came, he should
wish me to take my meals with them, but that meanwhile he would
be glad if I would breakfast with him and his wife.&nbsp; This
accordingly I did.&nbsp; What his wife was like I have almost
entirely forgotten, and I only saw her once again.&nbsp; After
breakfast he said I could go for a walk, and for a walk I went;
wandering about the dreary, intermingled chaos of fields with
damaged hedges, and new roads divided into building plots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile one or two of the boys had made their appearance,
and I therefore had my dinner with them.&nbsp; After dinner, as
there was nothing particular to do, I was again dismissed with
them for a walk just as the light of the winter afternoon was
fading.&nbsp; My companions were dejected, and so was I!&nbsp;
The wind was south-easterly, cold, and raw, and the smoke came up
from the region about the river and shrouded all the building
plots in fog.&nbsp; I was now something more than
depressed.&nbsp; It was absolutely impossible to endure such a
state of things any longer, and I determined that, come what
might, I would not stop.&nbsp; I considered whether I should
leave without saying a word&mdash;that is to say, whether I
should escape, but I feared pursuit and some unknown legal
proceedings.</p>
<p>When I got home, therefore, I sought the principal, and
informed him that I felt so unwell that I was afraid I must throw
up my engagement at once.&nbsp; He naturally observed that this
was a serious business for him; that my decision was very
hasty&mdash;what was the matter with me?&nbsp; I might get
better; but he concluded, after my reiterated asseverations that
I must go, with a permission to resign, only on one condition,
that I should obtain an equally efficient substitute at the same
salary.&nbsp; I was more agitated than ever.&nbsp; With my
natural tendency to believe the worst, I had not the least
expectation of finding anybody who would release me.</p>
<p>The next morning I departed on my errand.&nbsp; I knew a poor
student who had been at college with me, and who had nothing to
do, and to him I betook myself.&nbsp; I strove&mdash;as even now
I firmly believe&mdash;not to make the situation seem any better
than it was, and he consented to take it.&nbsp; I have no clear
recollection of anything that happened till the following day,
excepting that I remember with all the vividness of actual and
present sensuous perception lugging my box down the ladder and
sending for a cab.&nbsp; I was in a fever lest anything should
arrest me, but the cab came, and I departed.&nbsp; When I had got
fairly clear of the gates, I literally cried tears of
joy&mdash;the first and the last of my life.&nbsp; I am
constrained now, however, to admit that my trouble was but a
bubble blown of air, and I doubt whether I have done any good by
dwelling upon it.</p>

215</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OXFORD STREET</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Until</span> I had actually left, I hardly
knew where I was going, but at last I made up my mind I would go
to Reuben Shapcott, another fellow-student, whom I knew to be
living in lodgings in one of the streets just then beginning to
creep over the unoccupied ground between Camden Town and
Haverstock Hill, near the Chalk Farm turnpike gate.&nbsp; To his
address I betook myself, and found him not at home.&nbsp; He,
like me, had been unsuccessful as a minister, and wrote a London
letter for two country papers, making up about &pound;100 or
&pound;120 a year by preaching occasionally in small Unitarian
chapels in the country.&nbsp; I waited till his return, and told
him my story.&nbsp; He advised me to take a bed in the house
where he was staying, and to consider what could be done.</p>
<p>At first I thought I would consult Mardon, but I could not
bring myself to go near him.&nbsp; How was I to behave in
Mary&rsquo;s presence?&nbsp; During the last few months she had
been so continually before me, that it would have been absolutely
impossible for me to treat her with assumed indifference.&nbsp; I
could not have trusted myself to attempt it.&nbsp; When I had
been lying alone and awake at night, I had thought of all the
endless miles of hill and valley that lay outside my window,
separating me from the one house in which I could be at peace;
and at times I scarcely prevented myself from getting up and
taking the mail train and presenting myself at Mardon&rsquo;s
door, braving all consequences.&nbsp; With the morning light,
however, would come cooler thoughts and a dull sense of
impossibility.</p>
<p>This, I know, was not pure love for her; it was a selfish
passion for relief.&nbsp; But then I have never known what is
meant by a perfectly pure love.&nbsp; When Christian was in the
Valley of the Shadow of Death, and, being brought to the mouth of
hell, was forced to put up his sword, and could do no other than
cry, O Lord, I beseech Thee, deliver my soul, he heard a voice
going before him and saying, Though I walk through the Valley of
the Shadow of Death, I will fear none ill, for Thou art with
me.&nbsp; And by and by the day broke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
said Christian, &ldquo;He hath turned the Shadow of Death into
morning.&nbsp; Whereupon Christian sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, world of wonders! (I can say no
less)<br />
That I should be preserved in that distress<br />
That I have met with here! Oh, blessed be<br />
That hand that from it hath delivered me!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was Christian&rsquo;s love for God, and for God as his
helper.&nbsp; Was that perfectly pure?&nbsp; However, this is a
digression.&nbsp; I determined to help myself in my own way, and
thought I would try the publishers.&nbsp; One morning I walked
from Camden Town to Paternoster Row.&nbsp; I went straightway
into two or three shops and asked whether they wanted
anybody.&nbsp; I was ready to do the ordinary work it of a
publisher&rsquo;s assistant, and aspired no higher.&nbsp; I met
with several refusals, some of them not over-polite, and the
degradation&mdash;for so I felt it&mdash;of wandering through the
streets and suing for employment cut me keenly.&nbsp; I remember
one man in particular, who spoke to me with the mechanical
brutality with which probably he replied to a score of similar
applications every week.&nbsp; He sat in a little glass box at
the end of a long dark room lighted with gas.&nbsp; It was a
bitterly cold room, with no contrivances for warming it, but in
his box there was a fire burning for his own special
benefit.&nbsp; He surveyed all his clerks unceasingly, and woe
betide the unhappy wretch who was caught idling.&nbsp; He and his
slaves reminded me of a thrashing-machine which is worked by
horses walking round in a ring, the driver being perched on a
high stool in the middle and armed with a long whip.</p>
<p>While I was waiting his pleasure he came out and spoke to one
or two of his miserable subordinates words of directest and
sharpest rebuke, without anger or the least loss of
self-possession, and yet without the least attempt to mitigate
their severity.&nbsp; I meditated much upon him.&nbsp; If ever I
had occasion to rebuke anybody, I always did it apologetically,
unless I happened to be in a flaming passion&mdash;and this was
my habit, not from any respectable motive of consideration for
the person rebuked, but partly because I am timid, and partly
because I shrink from giving pain.&nbsp; This man said with
perfect ease what I could not have said unless I had been wrought
up to white heat.&nbsp; With all my dislike to him, I envied him:
I envied his complete certainty; for although his language was
harsh in the extreme, he was always sure of his ground, and the
victim upon whom his lash descended could never say that he had
given absolutely no reason for the chastisement, and that it was
altogether a mistake.&nbsp; I envied also his ability to make
himself disagreeable and care nothing about it; his power to walk
in his own path, and his resolve to succeed, no matter what the
cost might be.</p>
<p>As I left him, it occurred to me that I might be more
successful perhaps with a publisher of whom I had heard, who
published and sold books of a sceptical turn.&nbsp; To him I
accordingly went, and although I had no introductions or
recommendatory letters, I was received, if not with a cordiality,
at least with an interest which surprised me.&nbsp; He took me
into a little back shop, and after hearing patiently what I
wanted, he asked me somewhat abruptly what I thought of the
miracles in the Bible.&nbsp; This was a curious question if he
wished to understand my character; but his mind so constantly
revolved in one circle, and existed so completely by hostility to
the prevailing orthodoxy, that belief or disbelief in it was the
standard by which he judged men.&nbsp; It was a very absurd
standard doubtless, but no more absurd than many others, and not
so absurd then as it would be now, when heresy is becoming more
fashionable.</p>
<p>I explained to him as well as I could what my position was;
that I did not suppose that the miracles actually happened as
they are recorded, but that, generally speaking, the miracle was
a very intense statement of a divine truth; in fact, a truth
which was felt with a more than common intensity seemed to take
naturally a miraculous expression.&nbsp; Hence, so far from
neglecting the miraculous stories of the Bible as simply outside
me, I rejoiced in them more, perhaps, than in the plain
historical or didactic prose.</p>
<p>He seemed content, although hardly to comprehend, and the
result was that he asked me if I would help him in his
business.&nbsp; In order to do this, it would be more economical
if I would live in his house, which was too big for him.&nbsp; He
promised to give me &pound;40 a year, in addition to board and
lodging.&nbsp; I joyously assented, and the bargain was
struck.</p>
<p>The next day I came to my new quarters.&nbsp; I found that he
was a bachelor, with a niece, apparently about four or five and
twenty years old, acting as a housekeeper, who assisted him in
literary work.&nbsp; My own room was at the top of the house,
warm, quiet, and comfortable, although the view was nothing but a
wide reaching assemblage of chimney-pots.&nbsp; My hours were
long&mdash;from nine in the morning till seven in the evening;
but this I did not mind.&nbsp; I felt that if I was not happy, I
was at least protected, and that I was with a man who cared for
me, and for whom I cared.&nbsp; The first day I went there, he
said that I could have a fire in my bedroom whenever I chose, so
that I could always retreat to it when I wished to be by
myself.&nbsp; As for my duties, I was to sell his books, keep his
accounts, read proofs, run errands, and in short do just what he
did himself.</p>
<p>After my first morning&rsquo;s work we went upstairs to
dinner, and I was introduced to &ldquo;my niece
Theresa.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was rather surprised that I should have
been admitted to a house in which there lived a young woman with
no mother nor aunt, but this surprise ceased when I came to know
more of Theresa and her uncle.&nbsp; She had yellowish hair which
was naturally waved, a big arched head, greyish-blue eyes, so far
as I could make out, and a mouth which, although it had curves in
it, was compressed and indicative of great force of
character.&nbsp; She was rather short, with square shoulders, and
she had a singularly vigorous, firm walk.&nbsp; She had a way,
when she was not eating or drinking, of sitting back in her chair
at table and looking straight at the person with whom she was
talking.</p>
<p>Her uncle, whom, by the way, I had forgotten to name&mdash;his
name was Wollaston&mdash;happened to know some popular preacher
whom I knew, and I said that I wondered so many people went to
hear him, for I believed him to be a hypocrite, and hypocrisy was
one of the easiest of crimes to discover.&nbsp; Theresa, who had
hitherto been silent, and was reclining in her usual attitude,
instantly broke out with an emphasis and directness which quite
startled me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The easiest to discover, do you think, Mr.
Rutherford?&nbsp; I think it is the most difficult, at least for
ordinary persons; and when they do discover it, I believe they
like it, especially if it is successful.&nbsp; They like the
sanction it gives to their own hypocrisy.&nbsp; They like a man
to come to them who will say to them, &lsquo;We are all
hypocrites together,&rsquo; and who will put his finger to his
nose and comfort them.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think so
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conversation I was always a bad hand at assuming a position
contrary to the one assumed by the person to whom I might be
talking&mdash;nor could I persistently maintain my own position
if it happened to be opposed.&nbsp; I always rather tried to see
as my opponent saw, and to discover how much there was in him
with which I could sympathise.&nbsp; I therefore assented weakly
to Theresa, and she seemed disappointed.&nbsp; Dinner was just
over; she got up and rang the bell and went out of the room.</p>
<p>I found my work very hard, and some of it even
loathsome.&nbsp; Particularly loathsome was that part of it which
brought me into contact with the trade.&nbsp; I had to sell books
to the booksellers&rsquo; assistants, and I had to collect books
myself.&nbsp; These duties are usually undertaken in large
establishments by men specially trained, who receive a low rate
of wages and who are rather a rough set.&nbsp; It was totally
different work to anything I had ever had to do before, and I
suffered as a man with soft hands would suffer who was suddenly
called to be a blacksmith or a dock-labourer.</p>
<p>Specially, too, did I miss the country.&nbsp; London lay round
me like a mausoleum.&nbsp; I got into the habit of rising very
early in the morning and walking out to Kensington Gardens and
back before breakfast, varying my route occasionally so as even
to reach Battersea Bridge, which was always a favourite spot with
me.&nbsp; Kensington Gardens and Battersea Bridge were poor
substitutes for the downs, and for the level stretch by the river
towards the sea where I first saw Mardon, but we make too much of
circumstances, and the very pressure of London produced a
sensibility to whatever loveliness could be apprehended there,
which was absent when loveliness was always around me.&nbsp; The
stars seen in Oxford Street late one night; a sunset one summer
evening from Lambeth pier; and, above everything, Piccadilly very
early one summer morning, abide with me still, when much that was
more romantic has been forgotten.&nbsp; On the whole, I was not
unhappy.&nbsp; The constant outward occupation prevented any
eating of the heart or undue brooding over problems which were
insoluble, at least for my intellect, and on that very account
fascinated me the more.</p>
<p>I do not think that Wollaston cared much for me
personally.&nbsp; He was a curious compound, materialistic yet
impulsive, and for ever drawn to some new thing; without any love
for anybody particularly, as far as I could see, and yet with
much more general kindness and philanthropy than many a man
possessing much stronger sympathies and antipathies.&nbsp; There
was no holy of holies in him, into which one or two of the elect
could occasionally be admitted and feel God to be there.&nbsp; He
was no temple, but rather a comfortable, hospitable house open to
all friends, well furnished with books and pictures, and free to
every guest from garret to cellar.&nbsp; He had
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; notions about the relationship between the
sexes.&nbsp; Not that he was a libertine, but he disbelieved in
marriage, excepting for so long as husband and wife are a
necessity to one another.&nbsp; If one should find the other
uninteresting, or somebody else more interesting, he thought
there ought to be a separation.</p>
<p>All this I soon learned from him, for he was communicative
without any reserve.&nbsp; His treatment of his niece was
peculiar.&nbsp; He would talk on all kinds of subjects before
her, for he had a theory that she ought to receive precisely the
same social training as men, and should know just what men
knew.&nbsp; He was never coarse, but on the other hand he would
say things to her in my presence which brought a flame into my
face.&nbsp; What the evil consequences of this might be, I could
not at once foresee, but one good result obviously was, that in
his house there was nothing of that execrable practice of talking
down to women; there was no change of level when women were
present.</p>
<p>One day he began to speak about a novel which everybody was
reading then, and I happened to say that I wished people who
wrote novels would not write as if love were the very centre and
sum of human existence.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s life was made up of
so much besides love, and yet novelists were never weary of
repeating the same story, telling it over and over again in a
hundred different forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not agree with you,&rdquo; said Theresa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I disagree with you utterly.&nbsp; I dislike foolish,
inane sentiment&mdash;it makes me sick; but I do believe, in the
first place, that no man was ever good for anything who has not
been devoured, I was going to say, by a great devotion to a
woman.&nbsp; The lives of your great men are as much the history
of women whom they adored as of themselves.&nbsp; Dante, Byron,
Shelley, it is the same with all of them, and there is no mistake
about it; it is the great fact of life.&nbsp; What would
Shakespeare be without it? and Shakespeare is life.&nbsp; A man,
worthy to be named a man, will find the fact of love perpetually
confronting him till he reaches old age, and if he be not ruined
by worldliness or dissipation, will be troubled by it when he is
fifty as much as when he was twenty-five.&nbsp; It is the subject
of all subjects.&nbsp; People abuse love, and think it the cause
of half the mischief in the world.&nbsp; It is the one thing that
keeps the world straight, and if it were not for that
overpowering instinct, human nature would fall asunder; would be
the prey of inconceivable selfishness and vices, and finally,
there would be universal suicide.&nbsp; I did not intend to be
eloquent: I hate being eloquent.&nbsp; But you did not mean what
you said; you spoke from the head or teeth merely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theresa&rsquo;s little speech was delivered not with any heat
of the blood.&nbsp; There was no excitement in her grey eyes, nor
did her cheek burn.&nbsp; Her brain seemed to rule
everything.&nbsp; This was an idea she had, and she kindled over
it because it was an idea.&nbsp; It was impossible, of course,
that she should say what she did without some movement of the
organ in her breast, but how much share this organ had in her
utterances I never could make out.&nbsp; How much was due to the
interest which she as a looker-on felt in men and women, and how
much was due to herself as a woman, was always a mystery to
me.</p>
<p>She was fond of music, and occasionally I asked her to play to
me.&nbsp; She had a great contempt for bungling, and not being a
professional player, she never would try a piece in my presence
of which she was not perfectly master.&nbsp; She particularly
liked to play Mozart, and on my asking her once to play a piece
of Beethoven, she turned round upon me and said: &ldquo;You like
Beethoven best.&nbsp; I knew you would.&nbsp; He encourages a
luxurious revelling in the incomprehensible and indefinably
sublime.&nbsp; He is not good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My work was so hard, and the hours were so long, that I had
little or no time for reading, nor for thinking either, except so
far as Wollaston and Theresa made me think.&nbsp; Wollaston
himself took rather to science, although he was not scientific,
and made a good deal of what he called psychology.&nbsp; He was
not very profound, but he had picked up a few phrases, or if this
word is too harsh, a few ideas about metaphysical matters from
authors who contemned metaphysics, and with these he was
perfectly satisfied.&nbsp; A stranger listening to him would at
first consider him well read, but would soon be undeceived, and
would find that these ideas were acquired long ago; that he had
never gone behind or below them, and that they had never
fructified in him, but were like hard stones, which he rattled in
his pocket.&nbsp; He was totally unlike Mardon.&nbsp; Mardon,
although he would have agreed with many of Wollaston&rsquo;s
results, differed entirely from him in the processes by which
they had been brought about; and a mental comparison of the two
often told me what I had been told over and over again, that what
we believe is not of so much importance as the path by which we
travel to it.</p>
<p>Theresa too, like her uncle, eschewed metaphysics, but she was
a woman, and a woman&rsquo;s impulses supplied in her the lack of
those deeper questionings, and at times prompted them.&nbsp; She
was far more original than he was, and was impatient of the
narrowness of the circle in which he moved.&nbsp; Her love of
music, for example, was a thing incomprehensible to him, and I do
not remember that he ever sat for a quarter of an hour really
listening to it.&nbsp; He would read the newspaper or do anything
while she was playing.&nbsp; She never resented his inattention,
except when he made a noise, and then, without any rebuke, she
would break off and go away.&nbsp; This mode of treatment was the
outcome of one of her theories.&nbsp; She disbelieved altogether
in punishment, except when it was likely to do good, either to
the person punished or to others.&nbsp; &ldquo;A good deal of
punishment,&rdquo; she used to say, &ldquo;is mere useless
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Theresa and her uncle were kind and human, and I
endeavoured to my utmost to repay them by working my
hardest.&nbsp; My few hours of leisure were sweet, and when I
spent them with Wollaston and Theresa, were interesting.&nbsp; I
often asked myself why I found this mode of existence more
tolerable than any other I had hitherto enjoyed.&nbsp; I had, it
is true, an hour or two&rsquo;s unspeakable peace in the early
morning, but, as I have said, at nine my toil commenced, and,
with a very brief interval for meals, lasted till seven.&nbsp;
After seven I was too tired to do anything by myself, and could
only keep awake if I happened to be in company.</p>
<p>One reason certainly why I was content, was Theresa
herself.&nbsp; She was a constant study to me, and I could not
for a long time obtain any consistent idea of her.&nbsp; She was
not a this or a that or the other.&nbsp; She could not be
summarily dismissed into any ordinary classification.&nbsp; At
first I was sure she was hard, but I found by the merest accident
that nearly all her earnings were given with utmost secrecy to
support a couple of poor relatives.&nbsp; Then I thought her
self-conscious, but this, when I came to think upon it, seemed a
mere word.&nbsp; She was one of those women, and very rare they
are, who deal in ideas, and reflectiveness must be
self-conscious.&nbsp; At times she appeared passionless, so
completely did her intellect dominate, and so superior was she to
all the little arts and weaknesses of women; but this was a
criticism she contradicted continually.</p>
<p>There was very little society at the Wollastons&rsquo;, but
occasionally a few friends called.&nbsp; One evening there was a
little party, and the conversation flagged.&nbsp; Theresa said
that it was a great mistake to bring people together with nothing
special to do but talk.&nbsp; Nothing is more tedious than to be
in a company assembled for no particular reason, and every host,
if he asks more than two persons at the outside, ought to provide
some entertainment.&nbsp; Talking is worth nothing unless it is
perfectly spontaneous, and it cannot be spontaneous if there are
sudden and blank silences, and nobody can think of a fresh
departure.&nbsp; The master of the house is bound to do
something.&nbsp; He ought to hire a Punch and Judy show, or get
up a dance.</p>
<p>This spice of bitterness and flavour of rudeness was
altogether characteristic of Theresa, and somebody resented it by
reminding her that <i>she</i> was the hostess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that is why I said it: what
shall I do?&rdquo;&nbsp; One of her gifts was memory, and her
friends cried out at once that she should recite something.&nbsp;
She hesitated a little, and then throwing herself back in her
chair, began <i>The Lass of Lochroyan</i>.&nbsp; At first she was
rather diffident, but she gathered strength as she went on.&nbsp;
There is a passage in the middle of the poem in which Lord
Gregory&rsquo;s cruel mother pretends she is Lord Gregory, and
refuses to recognise his former love, Annie of Lochroyan, as she
stands outside his tower.&nbsp; The mother calls to Annie from
the inside&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gin thou be Annie of Lochroyan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (As I trow thou binna she),<br />
Now tell me some of the love tok&egrave;ns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That passed between thee and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dinna ye mind, Lord Gregory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As we sat at the wine,<br />
We changed the rings frae our fingers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can show thee thine?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yours was gude, and gude enough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But aye the best was mine;<br />
For yours was o&rsquo; the gude red gowd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>But mine o&rsquo; the diamond
fine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last verse is as noble as anything in any ballad in the
English language, and I thought that when Theresa was half way
through it her voice shook a good deal.&nbsp; There was a glass
of flowers standing near her, and just as she came to an end her
arm moved and the glass was in a moment on the floor, shivered
into twenty pieces.&nbsp; I happened to be watching her, and felt
perfectly sure that the movement of her arm was not accidental,
and that her intention was to conceal, by the apparent mishap, an
emotion which was increasing and becoming inconvenient.&nbsp; At
any rate, if that was her object it was perfectly accomplished,
for the recitation was abruptly terminated, there was general
commiseration over the shattered vase, and when the pieces were
picked up and order was restored, it was nearly time to
separate.</p>
<p>Two of my chief failings were forgetfulness and a want of
thoroughness in investigation.&nbsp; What misery have I not
suffered from insufficient presentation of a case to myself, and
from prompt conviction of insufficiency and inaccuracy by the
person to whom I in turn presented it!&nbsp; What misery have I
not suffered from the discovery that explicit directions to me
had been overlooked or only half understood!</p>
<p>One day in particular, I had to take round a book to be
&ldquo;subscribed&rdquo; which Wollaston had just
published&mdash;that is to say, I had to take a copy to each of
the leading booksellers to see how many they would
purchase.&nbsp; Some books are sold &ldquo;thirteen as
twelve,&rdquo; the thirteenth book being given to the purchaser
of twelve, and some are sold &ldquo;twenty-five as
twenty-four.&rdquo;&nbsp; This book was to be sold
&ldquo;twenty-five as twenty-four,&rdquo; according to
Wollaston&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; I subscribed it thirteen as
twelve.&nbsp; Wollaston was annoyed, as I could see, for I had to
go over all my work again, but in accordance with his fixed
principles, he was not out of temper.</p>
<p>It so happened that that same day he gave me some business
correspondence which I was to look through; and having looked
through it, I was to answer the last letter in the sense which he
indicated.&nbsp; I read the correspondence and wrote the letter
for his signature.&nbsp; As soon as he saw it, he pointed out to
me that I had only half mastered the facts, and that my letter
was all wrong.&nbsp; This greatly disturbed me, not only because
I had vexed him and disappointed him, but because it was renewed
evidence of my weakness.&nbsp; I thought that if I was incapable
of getting to the bottom of such a very shallow complication as
this, of what value were any of my thinkings on more difficult
subjects, and I fell a prey to self-contempt and
scepticism.&nbsp; Contempt from those about us is hard to bear,
but God help the poor wretch who contemns himself.</p>
<p>How well I recollect the early walk on the following morning
in Kensington Gardens, the feeling of my own utter worthlessness,
and the longing for death as the cancellation of the blunder of
my existence!&nbsp; I went home, and after breakfast some proofs
came from the printer of a pamphlet which Wollaston had in
hand.&nbsp; Without unfastening them, he gave them to me, and
said that as he had no time to read them himself, I must go
upstairs to Theresa&rsquo;s study and read them off with
her.&nbsp; Accordingly I went and began to read.&nbsp; She took
the manuscript and I took the proof.&nbsp; She read about a page,
and then she suddenly stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mr.
Rutherford,&rdquo; she said, it, &ldquo;what have you done?&nbsp;
I heard my uncle distinctly tell you to mark on the manuscript
when it went to the printer, that it was to be printed in demy
octavo, and you have marked it twelvemo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had had little sleep that night, I was exhausted with my
early walk, and suddenly the room seemed to fade from me and I
fainted.&nbsp; When I came to myself, I found that Theresa had
not sought for any help; she had done all that ought to be
done.&nbsp; She had unfastened my collar and had sponged my face
with cold water.&nbsp; The first thing I saw as I gradually
recovered myself, was her eyes looking steadily at me as she
stood over me, and I felt her hand upon my head.&nbsp; When she
was sure I was coming to myself, she held off and sat down in her
chair.</p>
<p>I was a little hysterical, and after the fit was over I broke
loose.&nbsp; With a storm of tears, I laid open all my
heart.&nbsp; I told her how nothing I had ever attempted had
succeeded; that I had never even been able to attain that degree
of satisfaction with myself and my own conclusions, without which
a man cannot live; and that now I found I was useless, even to
the best friends I had ever known, and that the meanest clerk in
the city would serve them better than I did.&nbsp; I was beside
myself, and I threw myself on my knees, burying my face in
Theresa&rsquo;s lap and sobbing convulsively.&nbsp; She did not
repel me, but she gently passed her fingers through my
hair.&nbsp; Oh, the transport of that touch!&nbsp; It was as if
water had been poured on a burnt hand, or some miraculous Messiah
had soothed the delirium of a fever-stricken sufferer, and
replaced his visions of torment with dreams of Paradise.</p>
<p>She gently lifted me up, and as I rose I saw her eyes too were
wet.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
cannot talk to you now.&nbsp; You are not strong enough, and for
that matter, nor am I, but let me say this to you, that you are
altogether mistaken about yourself.&nbsp; The meanest clerk in
the city could not take your place here.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was
just a slight emphasis I thought upon the word
&ldquo;here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
had better go.&nbsp; I will see about the pamphlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went out mechanically, and I anticipate my story so far as
to say that, two days after, another proof came in the proper
form.&nbsp; I went to the printer to offer to pay for setting it
up afresh, and was told that Miss Wollaston had been there and
had paid herself for the rectification of the mistake, giving
special injunctions that no notice of it was to be given to her
uncle.&nbsp; I should like to add one more beatitude to those of
the gospels and to say, Blessed are they who heal us of
self-despisings.&nbsp; Of all services which can be done to man,
I know of none more precious.</p>
<p>When I went back to my work I worshipped Theresa, and was
entirely overcome with unhesitating, absorbing love for
her.&nbsp; I saw no thing more of her that day nor the next
day.&nbsp; Her uncle told me that she had gone into the country,
and that probably she would not return for some time, as she had
purposed paying a lengthened visit to a friend at a
distance.&nbsp; I had a mind to write to her; but I felt as I
have often felt before in great crises, a restraint which was
gentle and incomprehensible, but nevertheless unmistakable.&nbsp;
I suppose it is not what would be called conscience, as
conscience is supposed to decide solely between right and wrong,
but it was none the less peremptory, although its voice was so
soft and low that it might easily have been overlooked.&nbsp;
Over and over again, when I have purposed doing a thing, have I
been impeded or arrested by this same silent monitor, and never
have I known its warnings to be the mere false alarms of
fancy.</p>
<p>After a time, the thought of Mary recurred to me.&nbsp; I was
distressed to find that, in the very height of my love for
Theresa, my love for Mary continued unabated.&nbsp; Had it been
otherwise, had my affection for Mary grown dim, I should not have
been so much perplexed, but it did not.&nbsp; It may be
ignominious to confess it, but so it was; I simply record the
fact.</p>
<p>I had not seen Mardon since that last memorable evening at his
house, but one day as I was sitting in the shop, who should walk
it in but Mary herself.&nbsp; The meeting, although strange, was
easily explained.&nbsp; Her father was ill, and could do nothing
but read.&nbsp; Wollaston published free-thinking books, and
Mardon had noticed in an advertisement the name of a book which
he particularly wished to see.&nbsp; Accordingly he sent Mary for
it.&nbsp; She pressed me very much to call on him.&nbsp; He had
talked about me a good deal, and had written to me at the last
address he knew, but the letter had been returned through the
dead-letter office.</p>
<p>It was a week before I could go, and when did go, I found him
much worse than I had imagined him to be.&nbsp; There was no
virulent disease of any particular organ, but he was slowly
wasting away from atrophy, and he knew, or thought he knew, he
should not recover.&nbsp; But he was perfectly
self-possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to immortality,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
never know what men mean by it.&nbsp; <i>What</i> self is it
which is to be immortal?&nbsp; Is it really desired by anybody
that he should continue to exist for ever with his present
limitations and failings?&nbsp; Yet if these are not continued,
the man does not continue, but something else, a totally
different person.&nbsp; I believe in the survival of life and
thought.&nbsp; People think is not enough.&nbsp; They say they
want the survival of their personality.&nbsp; It is very
difficult to express any conjecture upon the matter, especially
now when I am weak, and I have no system&mdash;nothing but
surmises.&nbsp; One thing I am sure of&mdash;that a man ought to
rid himself as much as possible of the miserable egotism which is
so anxious about self, and should be more and more anxious about
the Universal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mardon grew slowly worse.&nbsp; The winter was coming on, and
as the temperature fell and the days grew darker, he
declined.&nbsp; With all his heroism and hardness he had a
weakness or two, and one was, that he did not want to die in
London or be buried there.&nbsp; So we got him down to Sandgate
near Hythe, and procured lodging for him close to the sea, so
that he could lie in bed and watch the sun and moon rise over the
water.&nbsp; Mary, of course, remained with him, and I returned
to London.</p>
<p>Towards the end of November I got a letter, to tell me that if
I wished to see him alive again, I must go down at once.&nbsp; I
went that day, and I found that the doctor had been and had said
that before the morning the end must come.&nbsp; Mardon was
perfectly conscious, in no pain, and quite calm.&nbsp; He was
just able to speak.&nbsp; When I went into his bedroom, he
smiled, and without any preface or introduction he said:
&ldquo;Learn not to be over-anxious about meeting troubles and
solving difficulties which time will meet and solve for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Excepting to ask for water, I don&rsquo;t think
he spoke again.</p>
<p>All that night Mary and I watched in that topmost garret
looking out over the ocean.&nbsp; It was a night entirely
unclouded, and the moon was at the full.&nbsp; Towards daybreak
her father moaned a little, then became quite quiet, and just as
the dawn was changing to sunrise, he passed away.&nbsp; What a
sunrise it was!&nbsp; For about half-an-hour before the sun
actually appeared, the perfectly smooth water was one mass of
gently heaving opaline lustre.&nbsp; Not a sound was to be heard,
and over in the south-east hung the planet Venus.&nbsp; Death was
in the chamber, but the surpassing splendour of the pageant
outside arrested us, and we sat awed and silent.&nbsp; Not till
the first burning-point of the great orb itself emerged above the
horizon, not till the day awoke with its brightness and brought
with it the sounds of the day and its cares, did we give way to
our grief.</p>
<p>It was impossible for me to stay.&nbsp; It was not that I was
obliged to get back to my work in London, but I felt that Mary
would far rather be alone, and that it would not be proper for me
to remain.&nbsp; The woman of the house in which the lodgings
were was very kind, and promised to do all that was
necessary.&nbsp; It was arranged that I should come down again to
the funeral.</p>
<p>So I went back to London.&nbsp; Before I had got twenty miles
on my journey the glory of a few hours had turned into autumn
storm.&nbsp; The rain came down in torrents, and the wind rushed
across the country in great blasts, stripping the trees, and
driving over the sky with hurricane speed great masses of
continuous cloud, which mingled earth and heaven.&nbsp; I thought
of all the ships which were on the sea in the night, sailing
under the serene stars which I had seen rise and set; I thought
of Mardon lying dead, and I thought of Mary.&nbsp; The
simultaneous passage through great emotions welds souls, and
begets the strongest of all forms of love.&nbsp; Those who have
sobbed together over a dead friend, who have held one
another&rsquo;s hands in that dread hour, feel a bond of
sympathy, pure and sacred, which nothing can dissolve.</p>
<p>I went to the funeral as appointed.&nbsp; There was some
little difficulty about it, for Mary, who knew her father so
well, was unconquerably reluctant that an inconsistency should
crown the career of one who, all through life, had been so
completely self-accordant.&nbsp; She could not bear that he
should be buried with a ceremony which he despised, and she was
altogether free from that weakness which induces a compliance
with the rites of the Church from persons who avow themselves
sceptics.</p>
<p>At last a burying-ground was found, belonging to a little
half-forsaken Unitarian chapel; and there Mardon was laid.&nbsp;
A few friends came from London, one of whom had been a Unitarian
minister, and he &ldquo;conducted the service,&rdquo; such as it
was.&nbsp; It was of the simplest kind.&nbsp; The body was taken
to the side of the grave, and before it was lowered a few words
were said, calling to mind all the virtues of him whom we had
lost.&nbsp; These the speaker presented to us with much power and
sympathy.&nbsp; He did not merely catalogue a disconnected string
of excellences, but he seemed to plant himself in the central
point of Mardon&rsquo;s nature, and to see from what it
radiated.</p>
<p>He then passed on to say that about immortality, as usually
understood, he knew nothing; but that Mardon would live as every
force in nature lives&mdash;for ever; transmuted into a thousand
different forms; the original form utterly forgotten, but never
perishing.&nbsp; The cloud breaks up and comes down upon the
earth in showers which cease, but the clouds and the showers are
really undying.&nbsp; This may be true,&mdash;but, after all, I
can only accept the fact of death in silence, as we accept the
loss of youth and all other calamities.&nbsp; We are able to see
that the arrangements which we should make, if we had the control
of the universe, would be more absurd than those which prevail
now.&nbsp; We are able to see that an eternity of life in one
particular form, with one particular set of relationships, would
be misery to many and mischievous to everybody, however sweet
those relationships may be to some of us.&nbsp; At times we are
reconciled to death as the great regenerator, and we pine for
escape from the surroundings of which we have grown weary; but we
can say no more, and the hour of illumination has not yet
come.&nbsp; Whether it ever will come to a more nobly developed
race we cannot tell.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Thus far goes the manuscript which I have in my
possession.&nbsp; I know that there is more of it, but all my
search for it has been in vain.&nbsp; Possibly some day I may be
able to recover it.&nbsp; My friend discontinued his notes for
some years, and consequently the concluding portion of them was
entirely separate from the earlier portion, and this is the
reason, I suppose, why it is missing.</p>
<p>Miss Mardon soon followed her father.&nbsp; She caught cold at
his funeral; the seeds of consumption developed themselves with
remarkable rapidity, and in less than a month she had gone.&nbsp;
Her father&rsquo;s peculiar habits had greatly isolated him, and
Miss Mardon had scarcely any friends.&nbsp; Rutherford went to
see her continually, and during the last few nights sat up with
her, incurring not a little scandal and gossip, to which he was
entirely insensible.</p>
<p>For a time he was utterly broken-hearted; and not only
broken-hearted, but broken-spirited, and incapable of attacking
the least difficulty.&nbsp; All the springs of his nature were
softened, so that if anything was cast upon him, there it
remained without hope, and without any effort being made to
remove it.&nbsp; He only began to recover when he was forced to
give up work altogether and take a long holiday.&nbsp; To do this
he was obliged to leave Mr. Wollaston, and the means of obtaining
his much-needed rest were afforded him, partly by what he had
saved, and partly by the kindness of one or two whom he had
known.</p>
<p>I thought that Miss Mardon&rsquo;s death would permanently
increase my friend&rsquo;s intellectual despondency, but it did
not.&nbsp; On the contrary, he gradually grew out of it.&nbsp; A
crisis seemed to take a turn just then, and he became less
involved in his old speculations, and more devoted to other
pursuits.&nbsp; I fancy that something happened; there was some
word revealed to him, or there was some recoil, some healthy
horror of eclipse in this self-created gloom which drove him out
of it.</p>
<p>He accidentally renewed his acquaintance with the
butterfly-catcher, who was obliged to leave the country and come
up to London.&nbsp; He, however, did not give up his old hobby,
and the two friends used every Sunday in summer time to sally
forth some distance from town and spend the whole live-long day
upon the downs and in the green lanes of Surrey.&nbsp; Both of
them had to work hard during the week.&nbsp; Rutherford, who had
learned shorthand when he was young, got employment upon a
newspaper, and ultimately a seat in the gallery of the House of
Commons.&nbsp; He never took to collecting insects like his
companion, nor indeed to any scientific pursuits, but he
certainly changed.</p>
<p>I find it very difficult to describe exactly what the change
was, because it was into nothing positive; into no sect, party,
nor special mode.&nbsp; He did not, for example, go off into
absolute denial.&nbsp; I remember his telling me, that to
suppress speculation would be a violence done to our nature as
unnatural as if we were to prohibit ourselves from looking up to
the blue depths between the stars at night; as if we were to
determine that nature required correcting in this respect, and
that we ought to be so constructed as not to be able to see
anything but the earth and what lies on it.&nbsp; Still, these
things in a measure ceased to worry him, and the long conflict
died away gradually into a peace not formally concluded, and with
no specific stipulations, but nevertheless definite.&nbsp; He was
content to rest and wait.&nbsp; Better health and time, which
does so much for us, brought this about.&nbsp; The passage of
years gradually relaxed his anxiety about death by loosening his
anxiety for life without loosening his love of life.</p>
<p>But I would rather not go into any further details, because I
still cherish the hope that some day or the other I may recover
the contents of the diary.&nbsp; I am afraid that up to this
point he has misrepresented himself, and that those who read his
story will think him nothing but a mere egoist, selfish and
self-absorbed.&nbsp; Morbid he may have been, but selfish he was
not.&nbsp; A more perfect friend I never knew, nor one more
capable of complete abandonment to a person for whom he had any
real regard, and I can only hope that it may be my good fortune
to find the materials which will enable me to represent him
autobiographically in a somewhat different light to that in which
he appears now.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
